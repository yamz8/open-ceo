# Term Sheet Glossary and Analysis Guide

## Economic Terms

### Pre-Money Valuation
**Definition**: Company value before the new investment
**Calculation**: Post-money = Pre-money + Investment amount
**Example**: $10M pre + $2M investment = $12M post-money

**Analysis tips**:
- Compare to recent comparable rounds (stage, industry, metrics)
- Consider dilution impact on founders
- Higher valuation isn't always better if terms are worse

### Post-Money Valuation
**Definition**: Company value after the new investment
**Your ownership** = Your shares ÷ Total post-money shares

### Option Pool
**Definition**: Shares reserved for future employee grants
**Typical size**: 10-20% of post-money

**Watch for**:
- Pool created from pre-money (dilutes founders more)
- Pool created from post-money (dilutes everyone equally)
- "Top-up" requirements that increase pool size

**Founder-friendly**: Pool sized based on actual 18-month hiring plan

### Liquidation Preference

**1x Non-Participating (Standard)**
- Investor gets back investment OR converts to common (whichever is higher)
- Example: $10M invested, $50M exit → investor takes $10M or 20% ($10M)

**1x Participating ("Double Dip") - AVOID**
- Investor gets back investment AND participates in remaining proceeds
- Example: $10M invested (20%), $50M exit → investor gets $10M + 20% of $40M = $18M

**Multiple Preferences (2x, 3x) - AVOID**
- Investor gets 2x or 3x their investment before common
- Significantly reduces founder returns in moderate exits

### Anti-Dilution Protection

**Broad-Based Weighted Average (Founder-Friendly)**
- Adjusts price based on weighted average of all shares
- Formula accounts for both price and amount of down round

**Narrow-Based Weighted Average**
- Less favorable, excludes some share classes from calculation

**Full Ratchet (AVOID)**
- Reprices all investor shares to new lower price
- Extreme dilution for founders in down round
- Example: Invested at $10/share, down round at $5 → all shares repriced to $5

### Dividends

**Non-cumulative (Standard)**
- Dividends only if declared by board
- Typically not paid in growth companies

**Cumulative (Less Favorable)**
- Dividends accrue whether or not declared
- Increases effective liquidation preference over time

## Control Terms

### Board Composition

**Typical structures**:
- Seed: 3 seats (2 founders, 1 investor)
- Series A: 5 seats (2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent)
- Series B+: 5-7 seats (varies)

**Watch for**:
- Investor majority control
- Excessive observer rights
- Veto rights over board decisions

### Protective Provisions

**Standard provisions** (reasonable investor protection):
- Sale of company
- New financing with senior rights
- Significant asset sales
- Charter amendments affecting investor class

**Aggressive provisions** (negotiate carefully):
- Approval for any debt
- Approval for any spending over $X
- Hiring/firing executives
- Entering new business lines

### Voting Rights

**Standard**: 1 share = 1 vote
**Watch for**: Super-voting shares that give disproportionate control

### Information Rights

**Standard**:
- Monthly/quarterly financials
- Annual budget
- Cap table access

**Watch for**: Excessive operational reporting requirements

## Founder Terms

### Founder Vesting

**Standard**: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
**Watch for**:
- Acceleration triggers (single vs double trigger)
- Vesting reset on new financing

**Single trigger**: Vesting accelerates on acquisition
**Double trigger**: Requires acquisition + termination (founder-friendly)

### Founder Restrictions

**Non-compete**: Usually 1-2 years post-departure
**Non-solicit**: Cannot recruit employees for 1-2 years
**CIIAA**: Invention assignment agreement

## Deal Terms

### Pro-Rata Rights
**Definition**: Right to invest in future rounds to maintain ownership %
**Standard**: Major investors (>X% ownership) get pro-rata
**Value**: Protects investor from dilution in up rounds

### Drag-Along Rights
**Definition**: Majority can force minority to sell in acquisition
**Standard**: Reasonable threshold (usually board + majority shareholders)
**Watch for**: Low thresholds that let investors force sale

### Tag-Along Rights
**Definition**: Minority can join if founders sell
**Purpose**: Ensures founders can't exit without investor

### Right of First Refusal (ROFR)
**Definition**: Company/investors can match any offer for shares
**Impact**: Can make secondary sales difficult

### No-Shop / Exclusivity
**Definition**: Period where founders can't solicit other investors
**Standard**: 30-45 days
**Watch for**: >60 days (too restrictive)

### Pay-to-Play
**Definition**: Investors must participate pro-rata or lose rights
**Benefit**: Protects against down round free-riders
**Consider**: Can be valuable in uncertain markets
