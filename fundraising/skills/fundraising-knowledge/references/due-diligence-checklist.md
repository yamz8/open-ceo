## Timeline Expectations

| Stage | DD Duration | Common Delays |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Pre-seed | 1-2 weeks | Cap table issues |
| Seed | 2-4 weeks | Missing IP assignments |
| Series A | 4-6 weeks | Financial reconciliation |
| Series B+ | 6-8 weeks | Legal/compliance issues |

### Common DD Killers

1. **Cap table mess**: Unclear ownership, missing 83(b)s
2. **IP issues**: No assignments, founder created IP elsewhere
3. **Customer concentration**: >30% revenue from one customer
4. **Legal disputes**: Undisclosed litigation
5. **Financial irregularities**: Revenue recognition issues
