## Detailed Analysis

### Economics

**Acme Ventures**
- Pre-money: $25M
- Investment: $8M
- Post-money: $33M
- Investor ownership: 24.2%
- Option pool: 15% (post-money, standard)

**Beta Capital**
- Pre-money: $22M
- Investment: $8M
- Post-money: $30M
- Investor ownership: 26.7%
- Option pool: 18% (pre-money, dilutes founders)

**Analysis**: Acme is ~$3M better headline valuation. More importantly, Beta's 18% option pool from pre-money effectively reduces founder valuation further. Net impact: Acme founders retain ~5% more ownership.

### Liquidation Preference

**Acme**: 1x Non-Participating
- Standard, founder-friendly
- In $50M exit: investor takes $8M or 24.2% ($12.1M) = $12.1M

**Beta**: 1x Participating
- "Double dip" structure
- In $50M exit: investor takes $8M + 26.7% of ($50M - $8M) = $8M + $11.2M = $19.2M

**Analysis**: Beta's participating preferred costs founders ~$7M in a $50M exit. Significant red flag.

### Anti-Dilution

**Acme**: Broad-based weighted average (standard)
**Beta**: Narrow-based weighted average (less favorable)

**Analysis**: If a down round occurs, narrow-based formula will dilute founders more significantly. Acme is more founder-friendly.

### Board Composition

Both: 5 seats (2 Founders, 2 Investors, 1 Independent)

**Analysis**: Standard structure. Key question: Who controls the independent seat selection? Negotiate for founder input.

### Option Pool

**Acme**: 15% post-money
- Standard size
- Dilution shared equally

**Beta**: 18% pre-money
- Above-market size
- Dilutes only founders/existing shareholders
- Effective valuation reduction of ~$4M

**Analysis**: Beta's pre-money pool significantly disadvantages founders. Always negotiate for post-money pools or smaller pre-money pools.

### Other Terms

**No-shop period**
- Acme: 30 days (standard)
- Beta: 45 days (on the longer end, but acceptable)

**Pro-rata rights**: Both standard
**Information rights**: Both standard

## Final Recommendation

**Choose Acme Ventures**

Key reasons:
1. Better headline valuation ($25M vs $22M)
2. Non-participating preferred vs participating (critical)
3. Post-money option pool vs pre-money
4. Broad-based vs narrow-based anti-dilution

The ~$3M headline difference understates the real gap. Between participating preferred and pre-money option pool, Beta's effective terms are ~$10M+ worse for founders in a moderate exit scenario.

**Negotiation strategy for Acme**:
- Accept terms as-is (already founder-friendly)
- Or: Push for $27M pre if you have leverage (Beta as backup)

**If you must take Beta**:
- Negotiate participating preference down to 1x non-participating
- Negotiate option pool to 15% or move to post-money
- These are worth more than a $3M valuation bump
