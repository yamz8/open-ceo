Hi Sarah,

I'm Alex Chen, founder of CloudMesh. We help SMB engineering teams monitor their cloud infrastructure without needing a dedicated DevOps hire.

Quick stats:
- $45K MRR, growing 80% month-over-month
- 120 paying customers (85% self-serve)
- NRR: 135%

The insight: AWS/GCP tools are built for enterprises with dedicated SREs. We built the "Datadog for SMBs" - 10-minute setup, $99/mo starting price.

I noticed your investment in SimpleOps and thought our approach to democratizing infrastructure tooling might resonate.

I'm raising a $2.5M seed to expand our engineering team and launch our enterprise tier. Would you have 20 minutes this week?

Best,
Alex Chen
