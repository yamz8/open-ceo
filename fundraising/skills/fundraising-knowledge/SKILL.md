# Fundraising Knowledge for Startup CEOs

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive fundraising guidance for VC-backed startup CEOs across all stages from pre-seed through Series C+. It covers pitch deck creation, investor outreach, term sheet analysis, and due diligence preparation.

## Pitch Deck Fundamentals

### Core Principles

Every pitch deck must answer three questions:
1. Why now? (Market timing and urgency)
2. Why you? (Team and unique insight)
3. Why this? (Product-market fit evidence)

### Deck Length Guidelines

| Stage | Slides | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| Pre-seed | 8-10 | 5-10 min |
| Seed | 10-12 | 10-15 min |
| Series A | 12-15 | 15-20 min |
| Series B+ | 15-20 | 20-30 min |

## Investor Outreach Best Practices

### Email Structure

**Subject line**: Keep under 50 characters, mention referral if warm intro
**Opening**: One sentence on why reaching out to THIS investor
**Body**: 3-4 sentences on company, traction, and ask
**Close**: Clear call to action (meeting request)

### Outreach Sequence

| Day | Action | Content |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 0 | Initial email | Introduction + ask |
| 3 | Follow-up 1 | New data point or news |
| 7 | Follow-up 2 | Social proof (new investor/customer) |
| 14 | Final follow-up | Direct ask for response |

### Warm vs Cold Outreach

- **Warm intro** (80% response rate): Through portfolio founder or mutual connection
- **Cold outreach** (5-15% response rate): Direct email with strong hook

## Term Sheet Analysis

### Key Terms to Evaluate

**Economics:**
- Pre-money valuation
- Investment amount
- Option pool (and who bears dilution)
- Liquidation preference (1x non-participating preferred is standard)
- Anti-dilution (broad-based weighted average is founder-friendly)

**Control:**
- Board composition
- Protective provisions
- Voting rights
- Information rights

**Other:**
- Pro-rata rights
- Drag-along/tag-along
- No-shop period
- Founder vesting

### Red Flags

- Participating preferred (double-dip)
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- Multiple liquidation preferences (>1x)
- Excessive board control
- Broad protective provisions
- Long no-shop periods (>45 days)
