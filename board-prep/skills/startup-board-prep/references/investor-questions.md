# Investor Questions & Response Strategies

Comprehensive guide to anticipating and preparing for tough board questions.

## Why This Matters

Investors ask challenging questions not to trip you up, but to:
- Understand risks and how you're managing them
- Test your depth of understanding of the business
- Ensure you're being realistic about challenges
- Help identify blind spots

Being well-prepared shows competence and builds trust.

## Questions to Prepare For Each Meeting

Before every board meeting, prepare answers for:

1. What's runway and when do we need to raise?
2. Why did we miss/beat forecast on [metric]?
3. What's driving changes in key metrics?

5. What do you need from the board?

### Likely Questions (Based on Current Context)
- Questions about any metric that changed significantly
- Questions about any initiative that's behind
- Questions related to current market conditions
- Questions about recent news (competitor moves, market events)

### Prepare Supporting Data
- Cohort analysis for retention questions
- Funnel metrics for growth questions

- Financial scenarios for cash questions

## Red Flags That Invite Scrutiny

Certain things trigger more questions. Be extra prepared if:

- You missed forecast significantly
- Churn increased
- Growth rate declined
- You had executive departures
- Runway is below 12 months
- Major competitor raised money
- Key customer churned
- You're asking for something unusual

## Building Trust Over Time

Long-term board relationships are built on:

1. **Consistency** - Deliver on what you say you'll do
2. **Transparency** - Share bad news proactively
3. **Preparation** - Come ready for questions
4. **Follow-through** - Close loops on past discussions
5. **Humility** - Acknowledge what you don't know

The goal isn't to have perfect answers—it's to show you understand the business deeply and are taking appropriate action.
