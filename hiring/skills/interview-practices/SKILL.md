# Interview Best Practices

## Overview

This skill provides guidance on designing effective interview processes, asking good questions, and evaluating candidates fairly and consistently.

## Interview Process Design

### Standard Interview Stages

| Stage | Purpose | Duration | Who |
|-------|---------|----------|-----|
| Phone Screen | Qualification, mutual fit | 30 min | Recruiter or hiring manager |
| Hiring Manager | Role fit, experience | 45 min | Hiring manager |
| Technical/Skills | Domain expertise | 60 min | Senior IC or specialist |
| Team Fit | Collaboration, values | 45 min | Future teammates |
| Executive/Final | Culture, closing | 30 min | Founder or executive |

### Principles

1. **Consistency:** Same process for all candidates at same level
2. **Structured:** Use scorecards, not gut feel
3. **Efficient:** Respect candidate time, minimize rounds
4. **Transparent:** Tell candidates what to expect
5. **Inclusive:** Train interviewers on bias, diverse panels

## Structured Interviewing

### Why Structure Matters

Unstructured interviews are poor predictors of job performance. Structured interviews:
- Ask same questions to all candidates
- Use defined evaluation criteria
- Rate on specific competencies
- Reduce bias in decision-making

### Competency-Based Evaluation

Define 4-6 competencies per role, then assess each:

**Example: Senior Engineer**
1. Technical problem-solving
2. System design
3. Code quality and testing
4. Collaboration and communication
5. Ownership and initiative
6. Learning and growth

### Rating Scale

| Score | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Does not meet - Significant gaps |
| 2 | Partially meets - Some gaps |
| 3 | Meets expectations - Would succeed |
| 4 | Exceeds - Above average for level |
| 5 | Strongly exceeds - Exceptional |

Anchor each score with specific examples for the role.

## Question Types

### Behavioral Questions

Ask about past experience. Best predictor of future behavior.

**Format:** "Tell me about a time when..."

**Examples:**
- "Tell me about a time you had to make a decision with incomplete information."
- "Describe a situation where you disagreed with a teammate. How did you handle it?"
- "Give me an example of a project that didn't go as planned. What did you learn?"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What was the result?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- "How did others react?"

### Situational Questions

Present hypothetical scenarios relevant to the role.

**Format:** "Imagine you're in this situation... How would you approach it?"

**Examples:**
- "You inherit a codebase with no tests. How do you prioritize what to test first?"
- "A key customer is threatening to churn. What's your approach to the conversation?"
- "Your team is behind on a deadline. What do you do?"

### Technical Questions

Assess domain-specific knowledge and skills.

**Types:**
- Coding exercises
- System design
- Domain knowledge
- Portfolio/work review

**Best practices:**
- Mirror actual work they'd do
- Allow multiple valid approaches
- Assess thinking process, not just answer

### Values/Culture Questions

Assess alignment with company values.

**Examples:**
- "What kind of work environment brings out your best work?"
- "How do you give feedback to teammates?"
- "Tell me about a time you took initiative beyond your role."

## Questions by Interview Stage

### Phone Screen (30 min)

**Goals:** Qualification, logistics, mutual interest

**Sample questions:**
1. Walk me through your background and what brings you to this opportunity
2. What are you looking for in your next role?
3. [1-2 role-specific qualifying questions]
4. What questions do you have about the role or company?

**Logistics to cover:**
- Compensation expectations
- Start date availability
- Location/remote preferences
- Visa status if relevant

### Hiring Manager (45 min)

**Goals:** Role fit, experience depth, working style

**Sample questions:**
1. What accomplishment from your last role are you most proud of?
2. Tell me about a challenging project and how you approached it
3. How do you prioritize when everything feels urgent?
4. What feedback have you received that you've acted on?
5. What would your manager say are your strengths and growth areas?

### Technical/Skills (60 min)

**Goals:** Domain expertise, problem-solving, quality bar

**Structure varies by role:**
- Engineering: Coding, system design, debugging
- Product: Product sense, prioritization, analytics
- Sales: Discovery, objection handling, pitch
- Design: Portfolio review, critique, process

### Team Fit (45 min)

**Goals:** Collaboration, communication, values alignment

**Sample questions:**
1. How do you like to receive feedback?
2. Tell me about a time you helped a teammate who was struggling
3. Describe your ideal working relationship with [other function]
4. What's something you believe that most people disagree with?
5. What do you do when you disagree with a decision that's been made?

### Executive/Final (30 min)

**Goals:** Culture fit, closing, answering questions

**Sample questions:**
1. Why this company at this stage?
2. What would make you wildly successful in this role?
3. What questions do you have about our strategy or vision?

**Closing:**
- Share enthusiasm (if genuine)
- Outline next steps and timeline
- Ask about their timeline and other processes

## Avoiding Bias

### Common Biases

| Bias | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Affinity | Favoring similar people | Diverse interview panels |
| Halo/Horn | One trait colors all ratings | Rate competencies separately |
| Confirmation | Seeking info that confirms initial impression | Structured questions |
| Recency | Overweighting recent answers | Take notes throughout |
| Leniency/Strictness | Rating everyone high/low | Calibrated rating scale |

### Inclusive Interviewing

- Use consistent process for all candidates
- Train interviewers on bias
- Diverse interview panels
- Evaluate against job requirements, not "culture fit"
- Give candidates context and preparation material
- Provide accommodations as needed

## Making Decisions

### Debrief Process

1. Interviewers submit written feedback before debrief
2. Share scores independently (prevent anchoring)
3. Discuss specific evidence for each competency
4. Identify and address disagreements
5. Make hire/no-hire recommendation

### Decision Framework

| Outcome | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| Strong Hire | Multiple 4-5 ratings, no major concerns |
| Hire | Meets bar on all competencies, no red flags |
| No Hire | Below bar on key competency, significant concern |
| Strong No Hire | Multiple gaps, fundamental misalignment |

### When to Pass

- "Not right for this role" is valid - don't lower bar
- Trust red flags from multiple interviewers
- Strong no-hires are just as important as strong hires
- Document concerns for potential future roles
