# Sustainable Pace for Founders

## The Myth of Hustle Culture

### What Gets Celebrated

- "I work 100 hours a week"
- "I'll sleep when I'm dead"
- "Outwork everyone"
- "No days off until we make it"

### The Reality

- Chronic overwork leads to:
  - Worse decision-making
  - Increased mistakes
  - Slower learning
  - Higher turnover (starting with you)
  - Damaged relationships
  - Health problems
- The companies we admire weren't built by burned-out founders
- Sustainable pace isn't lazy - it's strategic

### The Right Frame

**Not:** "How much can I work?"
**But:** "How can I be most effective over 5-10 years?"

Building a company is a marathon, not a sprint. Pace accordingly.

## Designing Your Sustainable Rhythm

### The Weekly Architecture

**Model week structure:**

| Time Block | Purpose | Hours |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Deep work | Strategic thinking, hard problems | 15-20 |
| Meetings | Team, 1:1s, external | 15-20 |
| Admin | Email, slack, coordination | 5-10 |
| Buffer | Unexpected, breaks | 5-10 |
| Recovery | Non-work, exercise, relationships | 20+ |

**Total work: ~45-55 hours.** Not 80.

### Energy Management Over Time Management

**High-energy time → High-leverage work**
- Strategy
- Hard decisions
- Creative thinking
- Difficult conversations

**Low-energy time → Low-leverage work**
- Email
- Routine meetings
- Admin tasks
- Catch-up

**Match your energy to your work.** Don't do deep thinking when you're depleted.

### The CEO Calendar Audit

**Current vs. Ideal allocation:**

| Activity | Current % | Ideal % | Change Needed |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Strategy/Vision | | | |
| People/Team | | | |
| Product | | | |
| Customers/Sales | | | |
| Fundraising/Board | | | |
| Admin | | | |
| Recovery | | | |

**Most founders need to:**
- Decrease: Admin, routine meetings
- Increase: Strategy time, recovery time

## Building Daily Practices

### Morning Routine (30-60 min)

The first hour sets the day. Protect it.

**Options (pick 2-3):**
- Physical: Exercise, yoga, walk
- Mental: Meditation, journaling
- Strategic: Review priorities, plan the day
- Personal: Family breakfast, quiet coffee

**The key:** Do this BEFORE checking email/Slack. Once you're reactive, it's hard to stop.

### Work Blocks

**Deep work blocks (2-4 hours):**
- Calendar blocked, no meetings
- Phone off, notifications off
- Work on highest-leverage items only
- At your best energy time

**Meeting blocks (2-3 hours):**
- Batch meetings together
- Include buffer between (not back-to-back)
- Leave time for follow-up

**Admin blocks (1-2 hours):**
- Batch email, Slack, approvals
- Don't sprinkle throughout the day
- Set expectations: "I check email at X and Y"

### Evening Shutdown (15-30 min)

Create a ritual that signals "work is done":

1. Review today: What got done?
2. Capture tomorrow: What's the #1 priority?
3. Clear loose ends: Quick responses, calendar check
4. Physical closure: Close laptop, leave workspace
5. Transition: Walk, shower, change clothes

**The goal:** When you're done, actually be done.

## Weekly Practices

### Protected Time

**Non-negotiable blocks:**
- [ ] 1 day minimum with no meetings
- [ ] Deep work blocks at best energy time
- [ ] Time with family/friends
- [ ] Physical activity
- [ ] One thing purely for enjoyment

### Weekly Review (30-60 min)

**Review:**
- What got done?
- What didn't happen that should have?
- What drained energy?
- What restored energy?

**Plan:**
- What's the #1 priority next week?
- What meetings can be declined/shortened?
- When is deep work scheduled?
- When is recovery scheduled?

### Digital Sabbath

**One day per week with minimal digital:**
- No work email
- Limited social media
- Phone on Do Not Disturb
- Be present with people and activities

**It's not about the rules. It's about practicing disconnection.**

## Monthly and Quarterly Practices

### Monthly Check-in

**Physical health:**
- Sleep quality
- Exercise consistency
- Nutrition patterns
- Any health issues emerging

**Mental health:**
- Overall mood/outlook
- Stress level
- Relationship quality
- Enjoyment of work

**Work patterns:**
- Hours trending up or down?
- Energy patterns
- Boundary violations
- Recovery adequacy

### Quarterly Reset

**Longer reflection:**
- Is this pace sustainable for another quarter?
- What needs to change?
- What's working well to protect?

**Real vacation:**
- Minimum 5-7 days
- Actually offline
- Different environment
- No "just checking in"

## Managing Energy Drains

### People Who Drain You

**Strategies:**
- Limit meeting frequency
- Add boundaries ("I have a hard stop")
- Batch interactions
- Consider if the relationship is worth it

### Tasks That Drain You

**Strategies:**
- Delegate when possible
- Batch into single time block
- Do during low-energy times
- Automate or eliminate

### Decisions That Drain You

**Strategies:**
- Reduce decision load (routines, defaults)
- Batch similar decisions
- Delegate where possible
- Accept "good enough" more often

### Meetings That Drain You

**Questions to ask:**
- Does this need to be a meeting?
- Do I need to be there?
- Can it be shorter?
- Is there a standing version to eliminate scheduling?

## When Pace Slips

### Early Warning Signs

- Working weekends again
- Exercise dropped
- Sleep getting worse
- Skipping meals or eating poorly
- Canceling personal plans
- Feeling resentful
- Sunday dread increasing

### Course Correction

**Immediate:**
- What's the minimum viable next 2 weeks?
- What can be dropped, delayed, delegated?
- When is the next real break?

**Short-term:**
- What caused the slip?
- What boundary needs reinforcement?
- What needs to change structurally?

**Ongoing:**
- Add monitoring: Weekly self-check
- Add accountability: Tell someone who will call you out
- Add friction: Make overwork harder

## The Permission Slip

Many founders need to give themselves permission:

- **Permission to rest** without feeling guilty
- **Permission to say no** to opportunities
- **Permission to leave things undone** without anxiety
- **Permission to have a life** outside the company
- **Permission to be human** and not a productivity machine

**Write your own permission slip. Seriously.**

"I give myself permission to __________________ because I know that taking care of myself is not selfish - it's what allows me to build something great over the long term."

## The Sustainable Founder Mindset

**Old thinking:**
- "I'll rest when we make it"
- "There's always more to do"
- "Taking breaks means I'm not working hard enough"
- "My worth comes from my output"

**New thinking:**
- "Rest is part of the work"
- "Sustainable pace enables greater total output"
- "Recovery is not optional"
- "I am more than my company"

**The goal:** Be able to do this for 10+ years, not burn bright and flame out.
