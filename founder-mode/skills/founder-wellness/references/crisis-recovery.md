# Crisis Recovery for Founders

When you're already in crisis - burned out, overwhelmed, or questioning everything - you need different strategies than prevention. This guide is for that moment.

## Recognizing You're in Crisis

### Signs You're Beyond Normal Stress

- Can't remember the last time you felt good about work
- Dreading getting up in the morning
- Physical symptoms (constant fatigue, frequent illness, headaches)
- Emotional numbness or frequent crying
- Unable to make decisions
- Snapping at people who don't deserve it
- Thoughts of quitting, disappearing, or worse
- "I can't do this anymore" on repeat

**If this is you: This is not normal. This is not sustainable. Something has to change.**

## Immediate Triage

### Step 1: Stop the Bleeding

**This week:**
- Cancel anything that isn't absolutely critical
- Tell your team you're taking a step back (you don't have to explain why)
- Take at least one full day off
- Sleep. Whatever it takes.
- Tell one person what's really going on

**You cannot pour from an empty cup. You have to pause to refill.**

### Step 2: Assess the Damage

Be honest with yourself:

**Physical:**
- How is your sleep? (Quality, duration)
- When did you last exercise?
- How are you eating?
- Any health issues you're ignoring?

**Emotional:**
- What's your baseline mood?
- What emotions are you avoiding?
- Who have you been taking it out on?
- How isolated do you feel?

**Mental:**
- Can you think clearly?
- How is your decision-making?
- What are you avoiding thinking about?
- Any catastrophic thinking?

**Relational:**
- How are your closest relationships?
- Who have you neglected?
- Who are you pushing away?
- Who could help if you let them?

### Step 3: Get Support Now

This is not the time to go it alone.

**Professional support:**
- Schedule with a therapist this week (not "someday")
- Call your doctor if you have physical symptoms
- If in acute crisis, use crisis resources (988, crisis text line)

**Personal support:**
- Tell one trusted person the truth about how you're doing
- Accept help when offered (stop saying "I'm fine")
- Let your partner/family know you're struggling

**Work support:**
- Tell your co-founder or leadership team you need support
- Consider telling your board (they've seen this before)
- Identify what can be delegated immediately

## The Recovery Path

### Phase 1: Stabilize (Weeks 1-2)

**Priority: Basic functioning**

- Sleep 7-8 hours (use medication temporarily if needed)
- Eat regular meals
- One walk outside per day
- Radically reduce workload (do only critical items)
- No major decisions
- Daily check-in with support person

**Mantra:** "I just need to stabilize. Everything else can wait."

### Phase 2: Recover (Weeks 3-6)

**Priority: Rebuilding energy**

- Reintroduce exercise (start light)
- Regular therapy sessions
- Gradually take on more (but not pre-crisis level)
- Process what happened (journaling, talking)
- Identify what led to the crisis
- Start rebuilding neglected relationships

**Mantra:** "Recovery is not linear. Some days will be harder."

### Phase 3: Restructure (Weeks 7-12)

**Priority: Preventing recurrence**

- What needs to change structurally?
- What boundaries need to be established?
- What support systems need to be built?
- What work patterns caused this?
- What personal patterns contributed?
- What does a sustainable future look like?

**Mantra:** "I will not go back to what broke me."

## Hard Conversations

### Telling Your Co-Founder

**What to say:**
"I need to talk to you about something important. I've been struggling more than I've let on, and I've hit a wall. I need to take some time to recover, and I need your support."

**What to ask for:**
- Cover for specific responsibilities
- Space to work reduced hours for a period
- Understanding without judgment
- Help protecting your recovery time

### Telling Your Board

**What to say:**
"I want to be transparent with you. I've been pushing too hard and have hit a point of burnout. I'm taking steps to address it, including [specific actions]. During this period, [co-founder/COO] will be taking on [specific responsibilities]. I expect to be back to full capacity in [timeframe]."

**What they need to hear:**
- You recognize the issue
- You have a plan
- The company has coverage
- There's a timeline

**Reality:** Good boards have seen this before. They'd rather know than have you pretend.

### Telling Your Team

**What to say:**
"I'm going to be stepping back a bit over the next [period] to recharge. [Person] will be handling [responsibilities]. I trust you all to keep things moving, and I'll be available for critical issues. This isn't a crisis - I'm being proactive about sustainability."

**What not to do:**
- Don't over-explain
- Don't apologize excessively
- Don't pretend nothing is happening

### Telling Your Partner/Family

**What to say:**
"I've been struggling more than I've shown you. I'm sorry for what that's meant for us. I need your support to get through this. Here's what I'm doing about it..."

**What they need:**
- Honesty about what's been happening
- Acknowledgment of impact on them
- A real commitment to change
- Ways they can help (or stay out of the way)

## Managing Work During Recovery

### The Minimum Viable CEO

**During recovery, focus only on:**
- Decisions only you can make
- Critical external relationships
- Team direction (but not execution)
- Your own recovery

**Everything else can wait or be delegated.**

### Setting Recovery Boundaries

**With team:**
- "I'm available for critical issues only"
- "Please route decisions through [person] first"
- "I'm offline between [hours]"

**With yourself:**
- Max [X] hours of work per day
- No work on [days]
- Daily recovery activity non-negotiable

### The Re-Entry Plan

When you're ready to increase capacity:

| Week | Capacity | Focus |
|------|----------|-------|
| Current | 30% | Critical only |
| +2 weeks | 50% | Add one priority area |
| +4 weeks | 70% | Add another area |
| +6 weeks | 80-90% | New sustainable normal |

**Never go back to 100% of old patterns. The old 100% is what broke you.**

## Preventing the Next Crisis

### Structural Changes

**What needs to change in your:**
- Work hours and patterns?
- Delegation and team capacity?
- Recovery and personal time?
- Support systems?
- Company structure or role?

### New Non-Negotiables

**Write them down:**
1. I will not ________________
2. I will always ________________
3. When I notice ________________, I will ________________
4. I will check in with ________________ regularly

### Early Warning System

**Define your personal red flags:**
- Sleep < X hours for Y days
- Skipping exercise for Z days
- Feeling ________________
- Avoiding ________________
- Others noticing ________________

**When red flags appear:**
- Immediate action: ________________
- Person to tell: ________________
- Emergency brake: ________________

## For the Darkest Moments

If you're having thoughts of self-harm or suicide:

**Remember:**
- This feeling is temporary, even though it doesn't feel that way
- You are not your company
- The company is not worth your life
- There are people who care about you
- There is help available

**Do this now:**
- Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
- Text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
- Tell someone you trust
- Go to an emergency room if needed

**The company can survive without you for a while. Your family and friends cannot survive losing you.**

## A Note on Coming Back

Recovery isn't failure. Taking time isn't weakness. The most effective founders are the ones who understand their limits and work sustainably.

You will come back different. That's the point.

You'll have:
- Better boundaries
- More self-awareness
- Clearer priorities
- Stronger support systems
- A healthier relationship with work

The crisis is awful. But it can also be the thing that finally forces the changes you needed to make all along.

You've got this. But you don't have to do it alone.
