# Founder Wellness

## Overview

Building a company is one of the most stressful endeavors a person can undertake. This skill provides frameworks for maintaining mental health, preventing burnout, and building sustainable practices for the long haul.

**Important:** This content is educational, not medical advice. If you're experiencing serious mental health challenges, please seek professional support.

## The Reality of Founder Mental Health

### The Statistics

- **72%** of founders report mental health impacts
- **30%** experience depression (vs 7% general population)
- **27%** experience anxiety
- Founders are **2x** more likely to have psychiatric conditions

### Why Founders Struggle

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Loneliness at the top | Can't fully share struggles with team, board, or often family |
| Identity fusion | When the company struggles, you feel like YOU are failing |
| Uncertainty | Constant ambiguity about whether you're making the right calls |
| Responsibility | Weight of people depending on you - team, investors, customers |
| Comparison | Seeing other founders' highlight reels, not their struggles |
| Loss of balance | Work expands to fill all available time and headspace |

### The Founder Paradox

You're expected to be:
- Confident AND humble
- Visionary AND practical
- Fast-moving AND thoughtful
- Optimistic AND realistic
- Strong AND vulnerable

No one can be all these things all the time. It's exhausting.

## Recognizing Burnout

### The Burnout Spectrum

```
Engaged → Overextended → Disengaged → Burnout → Crisis
```

Most founders operate at "Overextended" and think it's normal. It's not.

### Early Warning Signs

**Physical:**
- Chronic fatigue that doesn't improve with rest
- Getting sick more often
- Sleep problems (too much or too little)
- Neglecting exercise, nutrition

**Emotional:**
- Irritability and short temper
- Cynicism about the company or team
- Feeling detached or numb
- Dreading Mondays (or every day)

**Cognitive:**
- Difficulty concentrating
- Making more mistakes
- Avoiding decisions
- Forgetting things you normally wouldn't

**Behavioral:**
- Working more but accomplishing less
- Withdrawing from relationships
- Increasing alcohol, substances, or unhealthy coping
- Procrastinating on important things

### The Burnout Self-Assessment

Rate 1-5 (1=never, 5=always):

| Statement | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| I feel exhausted even after rest | |
| I feel emotionally drained by work | |
| I question whether my work matters | |
| I feel disconnected from my team | |
| I have trouble getting motivated | |
| I'm more cynical than I used to be | |
| I feel like I'm just going through the motions | |
| I'm neglecting personal relationships | |
| I can't remember my last real break | |
| I feel like I can't keep this up | |

**Total score:**
- 10-20: Normal stress range
- 21-35: Concerning - take preventive action
- 36-50: High burnout risk - need immediate changes

## Prevention Strategies

### Non-Negotiables

Define 3-5 things you will NOT sacrifice for work:

**Examples:**
- Sleep: 7+ hours, no exceptions
- Exercise: 3x/week minimum
- Family dinner: No meetings after 6pm twice/week
- Weekend day: One day with no work
- Vacation: One week per quarter, fully offline

**Then protect them ruthlessly.** When people push back:
"I'm not available then. Here's when I can do it."

### Energy Management

**Know your energy patterns:**
- When do you do your best thinking? (Protect that time)
- What activities drain you? (Minimize or batch)
- What recharges you? (Schedule it)

**The energy audit questions:**
1. After this activity, do I have more or less energy?
2. Is this energy worth the outcome?
3. Is there a less draining way to achieve this?

### Building Recovery Rituals

**Daily recovery:**
- 10-minute morning ritual (whatever grounds you)
- Lunch away from desk
- End-of-day shutdown routine
- Evening disconnection

**Weekly recovery:**
- One day with no work
- Time with people who aren't work-related
- Physical activity you enjoy
- Something that has nothing to do with the company

**Quarterly recovery:**
- Real vacation (not "I'll just check email")
- Reflection time
- Re-evaluation of priorities

## Building Support Systems

### The Founder Support Stack

**Layer 1: Professional Support**
- Therapist or counselor (proactive, not just when in crisis)
- Executive coach
- Advisor or mentor

**Layer 2: Peer Support**
- Founder peer group
- Close founder friends
- Industry community

**Layer 3: Personal Support**
- Spouse/partner
- Family
- Non-work friends

**Layer 4: Team Support**
- Co-founder relationship
- Leadership team
- Trusted direct reports

### Finding the Right Therapist

Many founders resist therapy. Reframe: Top athletes have coaches. Top founders should too.

**Look for:**
- Experience with entrepreneurs/high-achievers
- Understanding of startup dynamics
- Available scheduling (many offer evenings/early mornings)
- Good fit for your communication style

**First session questions:**
- Have you worked with founders before?
- What's your approach to work-related stress?
- How do you balance support with challenge?

### Founder Peer Groups

Being with other founders who understand is uniquely valuable.

**Options:**
- YPO/YEC (Young Presidents' Organization)
- Founders Forum
- Local founder dinners
- Accelerator alumni networks
- Industry-specific groups

**What to look for:**
- Similar stage/scale of company
- Confidentiality
- Regular meeting rhythm
- Mix of support and challenge

## Specific Challenges

### Founder Loneliness

**Why it happens:**
- Can't fully share with team (don't want to worry them)
- Can't fully share with board (don't want to seem weak)
- Can't fully share with family (they don't understand context)
- Other founders seem to have it together

**Strategies:**
- Find 1-2 founder confidants who you can be fully honest with
- Join a peer support group
- Get a therapist who understands startup life
- Remember: Everyone is struggling. They're just not posting about it.

### Imposter Syndrome

**The voice:** "I don't know what I'm doing. They're going to find out."

**Reality:** Most founders feel this way. It means you're being challenged.

**Strategies:**
- Keep a "wins" file - evidence that counters the narrative
- Ask: "Would I expect a first-time CEO to know this? Or am I learning?"
- Remember: You were chosen by investors who've seen hundreds of founders
- Talk to other founders - they feel the same way

### The Identity Trap

**The problem:** When company = you, company struggles = you fail

**Signs:**
- You can't talk about anything but work
- Your mood tracks the company's performance
- "How are you?" is answered with how the company is doing
- You've lost hobbies, friends, interests outside work

**Strategies:**
- Deliberately cultivate identity beyond founder
- Schedule non-work activities that matter to you
- Practice saying "the company is struggling" not "I'm failing"
- Remember: You are not your company

### The Comparison Trap

**The problem:** Comparing your inside to other founders' outside

**Reality:**
- That founder with the perfect LinkedIn presence? Probably struggling too.
- The founder who just raised? Still has a million problems.
- The acquisition you read about? 5 years of hell before the headlines.

**Strategies:**
- Limit social media exposure
- Have real conversations with founders (not just surface)
- Focus on your own journey, not others'
- Remember: The only comparison that matters is you vs. past you

- Thoughts of self-harm or suicide
