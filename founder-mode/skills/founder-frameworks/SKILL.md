# Founder Frameworks

## Overview

This skill provides mental models and frameworks for the core challenges founders face: prioritization, delegation, decision-making, and time allocation. These aren't generic productivity tips - they're battle-tested approaches for the unique chaos of building a company.

## Prioritization Frameworks

### The Eisenhower Matrix (Adapted for Founders)

| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|---|---|
| **Important** | DO: Crises, real deadlines, investor meetings | SCHEDULE: Strategy, hiring, product thinking |
| **Not Important** | DELEGATE: Routine ops, most meetings | DELETE: Busy work, perfectionism, "nice to have" |

**Founder trap:** Most founders spend too much time in "Urgent/Important" and never get to "Not Urgent/Important" - which is where the real CEO work lives.

### The Leverage Test

For any task, ask:
1. **Impact:** If this succeeds perfectly, how much does it move the company?
2. **Uniqueness:** Can only I do this, or could someone else?
3. **Multiplier:** Does this enable others to do more?

**High leverage activities:**
- Setting vision and strategy
- Hiring and developing key people
- Closing major customers/partners
- Fundraising
- Making irreversible decisions

**Low leverage activities (delegate these):**
- Routine operations
- Tasks you're good at but others could do
- Anything that doesn't require your judgment
- Admin, scheduling, coordination

### The One Thing

From Gary Keller: "What's the ONE thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"

Use this when everything feels important. Force yourself to choose.

### 10x vs 10% Framework

**10% work:** Incremental improvements, optimizations, doing more of the same
**10x work:** Strategic bets, new capabilities, step-change improvements

Founders should spend at least 20% of time on 10x work. Most spend close to 0%.

## Delegation Frameworks

### The Delegation Ladder

```
Level 1: Task Delegation
"Here's exactly what to do and how to do it"
- Good for: New employees, critical one-off tasks
- Risk: Creates dependency, doesn't scale

Level 2: Project Delegation
"Here's the outcome needed, figure out how"
- Good for: Developing employees, medium-stakes work
- Risk: May need coaching on approach

Level 3: Decision Delegation
"You own this area, make decisions, keep me informed"
- Good for: Experienced team members, repeatable decisions
- Risk: Requires trust and aligned judgment

Level 4: Outcome Delegation
"You own this metric/function, I trust you completely"
- Good for: Senior leaders, mature functions
- Risk: Requires excellent hiring
```

Most founders get stuck at Level 1. Push to Level 3+ wherever possible.

### The "Only I Can Do This" Test

For anything on your plate, ask:
- Could someone else do this 80% as well? → Delegate
- Could someone learn to do this? → Delegate and train
- Does this require my specific relationships? → Maybe keep
- Does this require my judgment on company direction? → Keep

### The Replacement Cost Framework

"What would I have to hire to replace myself in this function?"

- If the answer is "anyone competent" → You shouldn't be doing it
- If the answer is "a specialist" → Hire that person
- If the answer is "another founder/CEO" → Keep it

## Decision-Making Frameworks

### Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions

**Type 1 (Irreversible):** Big, hard-to-undo decisions
- Firing a co-founder, major pivots, large fundraises
- Take time, get input, sleep on it
- 80%+ confidence before deciding

**Type 2 (Reversible):** Most decisions
- Hiring, product features, process changes
- Bias to action - decide fast
- 70% confidence is enough
- Can course-correct later

Most founders treat Type 2 decisions like Type 1, causing paralysis.

### Pre-Mortem

Before a big decision:
1. Imagine it's 1 year later and this decision was a disaster
2. Write down everything that could have gone wrong
3. Work backwards: which risks can you mitigate?

### Second-Order Thinking

For any decision:
1. **First order:** What happens immediately?
2. **Second order:** And then what happens?
3. **Third order:** And then what happens after that?

Example: "We should cut prices"
- First order: More customers
- Second order: Lower margins, different customer segment
- Third order: May attract price-sensitive customers who churn more

### The Regret Minimization Framework (Bezos)

"When I'm 80 and looking back, will I regret not trying this?"

Best for: Career-defining, bet-the-company, or life decisions

## Time Allocation Frameworks

### Maker vs Manager Schedule (Paul Graham)

**Manager schedule:** Days broken into 1-hour blocks, meeting-driven
**Maker schedule:** Large uninterrupted blocks for creative/deep work

Founders need BOTH but usually get stuck in manager mode.

**Solution:** Protect maker time like a meeting. Block 3-4 hour chunks. Make them non-negotiable.

### The CEO Time Audit

How should a CEO spend time by stage?

| Activity | Pre-Seed | Seed | Series A | Series B+ |
|----------|----------|------|----------|-----------|
| Product | 40% | 30% | 20% | 10% |
| People | 20% | 25% | 30% | 35% |
| Customers/Sales | 25% | 25% | 20% | 20% |
| Fundraising | 10% | 15% | 15% | 10% |
| Strategy | 5% | 5% | 15% | 25% |

These shift dramatically by stage. What was right 12 months ago isn't right now.

### The Three Buckets

Every week, ensure you spend meaningful time in:
1. **Building** - Product, strategy, major initiatives
2. **People** - Hiring, developing, culture
3. **Selling** - Customers, investors, partnerships

If any bucket is empty for >2 weeks, something's wrong.
