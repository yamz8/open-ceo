# Delegation Playbook

## Why Founders Struggle to Delegate

### Common Blocks

| Block | Internal Voice | Reality |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Speed | "It's faster if I do it myself" | Short-term yes, long-term bottleneck |
| Quality | "No one else will do it as well" | 80% by others > 100% by you |
| Control | "I need to make sure it's done right" | Your job is outcomes, not oversight |
| Identity | "This is what I'm good at" | Your value is now in building the team |
| Trust | "I don't trust them to handle it" | Have you actually set them up to succeed? |
| Guilt | "I shouldn't push my work onto others" | It's their job, not a favor |

### The Real Cost of Not Delegating

- You become the bottleneck for everything
- Your team doesn't grow or develop
- You burn out doing work beneath your level
- The company can't scale past your capacity
- You can't do the work only you can do

## The Delegation Process

### Step 1: Identify What to Delegate

**Delegate when:**
- Someone else could do it 70%+ as well
- It's a learning opportunity for someone
- You're doing it out of habit, not necessity
- It doesn't require your judgment or relationships
- It's recurring or process-able

**Keep when:**
- Only you can do it (vision, key relationships, final decisions)
- It requires CEO-level judgment
- The stakes are company-defining
- It's your unfair advantage

### Step 2: Choose the Right Person

| Factor | Consider |
|--------|----------|
| Capability | Can they do this (with support)? |
| Capacity | Do they have bandwidth? |
| Growth | Will this stretch them appropriately? |
| Motivation | Are they interested in this area? |
| Reliability | Can you trust follow-through? |

**The 70% rule:** If they can do it 70% as well as you, delegate. They'll get better.

### Step 3: The Delegation Conversation

**The Brief:**
1. **What:** Clearly describe the task/project/responsibility
2. **Why:** Explain why this matters (context and stakes)
3. **Constraints:** Timeline, budget, must-haves vs nice-to-haves
4. **Success:** What does "done well" look like?
5. **Support:** What help is available? When to escalate?

**Key phrases:**
- "I'm giving you ownership of [X]..."
- "Success looks like [specific outcome]..."
- "You have authority to [make these decisions]..."
- "Come to me if [these situations arise]..."
- "I trust your judgment on [these aspects]..."

### Step 4: The Right Level of Involvement

**Match your involvement to their readiness:**

| Their Readiness | Your Role | Check-in Frequency |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| New to this | Coach: explain, demonstrate, observe | Daily |
| Some experience | Guide: outline approach, answer questions | 2-3x/week |
| Competent | Adviser: available if needed | Weekly |
| Expert | Sponsor: stay informed, remove blockers | As needed |

**Ramp down over time:** Start closer, then back off as they demonstrate capability.

### Step 5: Follow Through Without Micromanaging

**Do:**
- Set clear checkpoints upfront
- Ask "How's it going?" not "Did you do X?"
- Focus on outcomes, not methods
- Celebrate wins
- Help with blockers

**Don't:**
- Hover or check constantly
- Redo their work
- Give feedback on every detail
- Second-guess decisions you delegated
- Take it back at the first sign of struggle

### Step 6: Handle Issues

**When things go wrong (they will):**
1. Stay calm - this is normal
2. Understand what happened
3. Focus on learning, not blame
4. Adjust support level if needed
5. Don't take it back unless truly necessary

**When to take it back:**
- Critical failure that threatens the company
- Clear mismatch of capability and task
- They ask to be relieved

**Even then:** Try to find a different person, not do it yourself.

## Delegation Templates

### The Task Brief Template

```
Task: [What needs to be done]
Owner: [Person responsible]
Due: [Deadline]

Context: [Why this matters, background]

Success Criteria:
- [Specific outcome 1]
- [Specific outcome 2]

Constraints:
- [Budget/time/must-haves]

Your Authority:
- You can decide: [X, Y, Z]
- Check with me on: [A, B, C]

Support Available:
- [Resources, people to consult]

Check-ins:
- [When and how we'll sync]
```

### The Ownership Transfer Template

```
Function/Area: [What they now own]
Effective: [Date]

You are now responsible for:
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Ongoing responsibility]

You have authority to:
- [Decision type 1]
- [Decision type 2]
- [Resource allocation]

I will:
- [How you'll support]
- [What you'll stay informed on]
- [When you'll review together]

Escalate to me when:
- [Situation 1]
- [Situation 2]
```

## Building a Delegation Habit

### Weekly Delegation Review

Every week, ask:
1. What did I do this week that someone else could have done?
2. What am I holding that I should hand off?
3. Did I take anything back that I should have left delegated?

### The Delegation Inventory

Quarterly, list everything you do and categorize:
- **Keep:** Only CEO can do
- **Delegate now:** Others could do, should hand off
- **Delegate later:** Need to hire or train for this
- **Stop:** Shouldn't be done at all

### Tracking Progress

| What | Delegated To | Date | How It's Going | Notes |
|------|--------------|------|----------------|-------|
| | | | | |

Review this monthly. Celebrate successful handoffs. Learn from struggles.

## Common Delegation Mistakes

1. **Delegating and disappearing** - Set up check-ins
2. **Delegating without authority** - Give real decision power
3. **Delegating problems, not outcomes** - Be clear on what success looks like
4. **Delegating your accountability** - You're still responsible for results
5. **Delegating too soon** - Make sure they're ready (or ready enough)
6. **Delegating too late** - You've already burned out

## The Mindset Shift

**From:** "I need to do this well"
**To:** "I need to build a team that does this well"

**From:** "It's faster if I do it"
**To:** "It's more scalable if they do it"

**From:** "They'll mess it up"
**To:** "They'll learn by doing, like I did"

**From:** "I'm giving up control"
**To:** "I'm gaining capacity"
