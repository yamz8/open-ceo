# Decision Quality

## The Founder's Decision-Making Challenge

As a founder, you face decisions that are:
- High-stakes with incomplete information
- Time-pressured but with long-term consequences
- Uniquely yours (no one else has your context)
- Often irreversible

The goal isn't perfect decisions - it's systematically good decisions with faster learning from mistakes.

## Decision Quality Framework

Good decisions come from:
1. **Clear problem definition** - Are you solving the right problem?
2. **Sufficient information** - Not perfect, just sufficient
3. **Multiple options** - Not just yes/no
4. **Awareness of biases** - Know your blind spots
5. **Appropriate process** - Right rigor for the stakes
6. **Clean execution** - Commit fully once decided

## Decision Types and Appropriate Process

### Type 1: Irreversible, High-Stakes

Examples: Major pivots, co-founder changes, large fundraises, major market exits

**Process:**
- Take time (but not forever)
- Gather multiple perspectives
- Write out your reasoning
- Sleep on it
- Get board/advisor input
- Pre-mortem the decision

**Timeline:** Days to weeks

### Type 2: Reversible, Lower-Stakes

Examples: Most hiring, product features, process changes, experiments

**Process:**
- Decide quickly with available information
- Bias to action
- Set clear reversal triggers
- Learn and iterate

**Timeline:** Hours to days

### Type 3: Recurring Decisions

Examples: Pricing changes, vendor selection, routine approvals

**Process:**
- Create frameworks/policies
- Delegate to the team
- Review periodically

**Timeline:** Build once, delegate forever

## Decision-Making Tools

### The Decision Matrix

For decisions with multiple options and criteria:

| Option | Criterion 1 (weight) | Criterion 2 (weight) | Criterion 3 (weight) | Score |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Option A | | | | |
| Option B | | | | |
| Option C | | | | |

Useful for: Vendor selection, hiring between candidates, strategic options

### The Scenario Analysis

For decisions with uncertainty:

| Scenario | Probability | Option A Outcome | Option B Outcome |
|----------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Best case | 20% | | |
| Base case | 60% | | |
| Worst case | 20% | | |

Calculate expected value for each option.

### The Pre-Mortem

Before a big decision:
1. Assume it's one year later and the decision failed
2. List every reason it could have failed
3. For each risk, ask: Can we mitigate this?
4. Decide if the decision still makes sense

### The 10-10-10 Framework

Ask: How will I feel about this decision...
- 10 minutes from now?
- 10 months from now?
- 10 years from now?

Useful for: Emotional decisions, short vs long-term tradeoffs

### The Reversibility Test

| | Easy to Reverse | Hard to Reverse |
|---|---|---|
| **Low Stakes** | Just do it | Quick decision |
| **High Stakes** | Experiment first | Deliberate carefully |

Most decisions are more reversible than they feel.

## Cognitive Biases to Watch

### Confirmation Bias
**What:** Seeking information that confirms what you already believe
**Fix:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Assign someone to argue the other side.

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
**What:** Continuing because of past investment, not future value
**Fix:** Ask "If I were starting fresh today, would I make this same choice?"

### Anchoring
**What:** Over-weighting the first piece of information
**Fix:** Generate your own estimate before hearing others. Consider multiple anchors.

### Availability Bias
**What:** Over-weighting recent or vivid examples
**Fix:** Seek base rates and historical data, not just memorable cases.

### Overconfidence
**What:** Being more certain than the evidence warrants
**Fix:** Ask "What's the probability I'm wrong?" and take it seriously.

### Loss Aversion
**What:** Weighing losses more than equivalent gains
**Fix:** Reframe in terms of opportunity cost. What do you lose by not acting?

### Status Quo Bias
**What:** Preferring current state even when change is better
**Fix:** Evaluate the status quo as critically as any alternative.

## Decision Journals

Keeping a decision journal dramatically improves decision quality.

### For Each Major Decision, Record:

**Before deciding:**
- Date
- The decision
- Options considered
- What you decided
- Why (your reasoning)
- What would change your mind
- Expected outcomes
- Confidence level (0-100%)

**After time passes (30/90/365 days):**
- What actually happened
- Were your assumptions correct?
- What did you learn?
- What would you do differently?

### Review Patterns Quarterly

Ask:
- Which types of decisions do I make well?
- Where do I consistently misjudge?
- Which biases show up repeatedly?
- How can I improve?

## Making Hard People Decisions

People decisions (hiring, firing, promoting) have their own dynamics.

### The Hiring Decision

**Before deciding:**
- Have you seen them in multiple contexts?
- Did multiple people interview them?
- Are you solving for a real need or filling a slot?
- Are you lowering your bar due to urgency?

**Key question:** "If this person left in 6 months, would I be relieved or devastated?"

### The Firing Decision

**Signals it's time:**
- You've given clear feedback and time to improve
- You've asked yourself "Would I hire them again?" and the answer is no
- Other team members are suffering
- You're spending disproportionate time on them

**Key question:** "What would I tell a friend in this situation?"

### The Promotion Decision

**Ask:**
- Are they performing at the next level already?
- Do they have the skills for the new scope?
- Is this about rewarding past performance or investing in future capability?
- What happens to them if you don't promote?

## Speed vs Quality Tradeoffs

| Speed Priority | Quality Priority |
|----------------|------------------|
| Reversible decisions | Irreversible decisions |
| Clear right answer | Ambiguous tradeoffs |
| Low stakes | High stakes |
| Experimentation possible | One shot |
| Information won't improve | More info would help |

**Default:** Err toward speed. Most founders are too slow, not too fast.

## When Stuck

If you can't decide:

1. **Set a deadline.** "I will decide by [date] regardless."
2. **Lower the stakes.** "What would I do if I could easily reverse this?"
3. **Seek one more input.** Not ten more. One.
4. **Trust your gut.** If analysis is inconclusive, intuition has information too.
5. **Flip a coin.** Seriously. If you're disappointed by the outcome, you know what you actually want.

## The Meta-Decision

Sometimes the most important decision is: "How much process does this decision need?"

Don't bring a spreadsheet to a gut-feel decision.
Don't make a bet-the-company choice on a whim.

Match the rigor to the stakes.
