# Prioritization Deep Dive

## The Problem with Prioritization

Most prioritization advice assumes you have a clear list of options and just need to order them. Reality for founders:
- The list keeps changing
- Everything feels urgent
- You don't even know what you should be considering
- Saying no feels impossible

This guide addresses the real challenges.

## Advanced Prioritization Techniques

### 1. The Anti-To-Do List

Instead of adding more to your list, start by listing what you will NOT do:
- What meetings will you decline?
- What projects will you say no to?
- What "opportunities" will you pass on?
- What good ideas will you not pursue?

**The insight:** Your ability to do great things depends entirely on your willingness to not do good things.

### 2. The ICE Framework (Impact, Confidence, Ease)

For each potential priority, score 1-10:
- **Impact:** If this works, how big is the outcome?
- **Confidence:** How sure are you it will work?
- **Ease:** How easy is this to do?

**ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence × Ease) / 3**

Rank by ICE score. Do highest first.

**Founder modification:** Add a fourth factor:
- **Uniqueness (U):** Can only you do this?

**Modified Score = (I × C × E × U) / 4**

### 3. The Opportunity Cost Frame

For everything you're considering:
"By doing this, what am I NOT doing?"

Then ask: "Is this more valuable than what I'm giving up?"

### 4. The CEO Job Description Test

A CEO's job is roughly:
1. Set vision and strategy
2. Hire, develop, and retain great people
3. Make sure the company doesn't run out of money
4. Represent the company externally
5. Make decisions that only the CEO can make

For any task: "Is this actually in my job description?"

### 5. Time Horizon Prioritization

Categorize tasks by their impact horizon:
- **This week:** Urgent, must be done
- **This month:** Important, creates near-term value
- **This quarter:** Strategic, sets up future success
- **This year+:** Visionary, long-term bets

Most founders overweight this-week at the expense of this-quarter and this-year.

## Common Prioritization Traps

### The Busy Trap
Feeling busy ≠ being productive. Many founders stay busy to avoid hard, ambiguous strategic work.

**Fix:** Ask "Am I doing this because it's important or because it's comfortable?"

### The Squeaky Wheel Trap
Loudest problems get attention, not most important ones.

**Fix:** Distinguish signal from noise. Not all fires need to be fought.

### The Perfectionism Trap
Over-investing in things that are "good enough" already.

**Fix:** Ask "What would 'good enough' look like here?" Do that.

### The New Shiny Thing Trap
Every week brings new "opportunities" that distract from core priorities.

**Fix:** Have a clear "not now" list. Default to no on new things.

### The Founder Identity Trap
Doing things you did before (coding, sales calls, etc.) because it's who you are.

**Fix:** Your identity needs to evolve. You're not an engineer anymore - you're a CEO who used to engineer.

## Prioritization Rituals

### Daily: The Big 3
Each morning, identify exactly 3 things that must happen today.
Not 5. Not 10. Three.

### Weekly: The Priority Reset
Each week, review:
- What were my priorities last week?
- Did I actually work on them?
- What should be priorities this week?
- What am I saying no to?

### Monthly: The Zoom Out
Once a month:
- Are my weekly priorities aligned with quarterly goals?
- Am I working on the right level of work for my role?
- What should I stop doing?

### Quarterly: The Strategy Check
- Are priorities driving toward strategy?
- What needs to change for next quarter?
- What did I learn about prioritization this quarter?

## When Everything Feels Urgent

Emergency prioritization when overwhelmed:

1. **Brain dump:** Get everything out of your head onto paper
2. **Categorize:** Must do today / Must do this week / Everything else
3. **Ruthless cut:** Cross off at least 30% of "this week"
4. **Sequence:** What has to happen before what?
5. **Start:** Pick ONE thing and begin

**Mantra:** "I cannot do everything, but I can do one thing."

## Saying No

The hardest part of prioritization is saying no.

### To your team:
"That's a great idea, but it's not a priority for this quarter. Let's revisit in Q[X]."

### To investors/board:
"I hear that feedback. Here's what we're focused on and why. [X] is on our radar for later."

### To customers:
"We're not able to do that right now, but here's what we can do..."

### To yourself:
"I want to do this, but it's not the best use of my time right now."

### The No Script:
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Briefly explain current priorities
3. Offer alternative if appropriate
4. Don't over-explain or apologize

**Remember:** Every no protects a yes.
