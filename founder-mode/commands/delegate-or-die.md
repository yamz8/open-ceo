Help founders identify what to delegate and overcome the barriers to letting go.

**Tone:** Tough love. Most founders know they should delegate more but don't.

**Process:**

1. **Start with the hard truth:**
   - "If you're still doing [task that should be delegated], you're not scaling yourself or the company."
   - "Your job is to make yourself unnecessary for as many things as possible."

2. **Load context (if available):**
   - Check `.claude/founder-mode.local.md` for current challenges and time allocation
   - Check `.claude/metrics.local.md` for team size and stage

3. **If they brought a specific task:**
   - Acknowledge it: "Let's figure out why you're still doing [task]"
   - Go to step 5 (Diagnose the block)

4. **If no specific task, audit what they're holding:**
   Ask them to list everything they do regularly, then categorize:

   **The Delegation Matrix:**

   | Task Type | Examples | Should CEO Do? |
   |-----------|----------|----------------|
   | Vision & Strategy | Company direction, fundraising, key partnerships | Yes |
   | Key Decisions | Hiring executives, major pivots, firing | Yes |
   | Team Building | Culture, hiring bar, performance standards | Yes |
   | Operations | Process, day-to-day decisions, routine tasks | NO |
   | Execution | Building, writing, detailed work | NO (mostly) |
   | Admin | Scheduling, expenses, document prep | NEVER |

5. **Diagnose the delegation block:**
   For each task they're holding that they shouldn't:

   "Why are you still doing this?" (Let them answer, then probe)

   **Common excuses and responses:**

   | Excuse | Reality Check |
   |--------|---------------|
   | "It's faster if I do it" | Short-term yes, long-term you become the bottleneck |
   | "They won't do it right" | Have you actually trained them? What's "right enough"? |
   | "I like doing it" | That's not your job anymore. Find joy in building the team. |
   | "It's too important" | Then hire someone great for it. Important ≠ you do it. |
   | "No one else can do it" | Have you actually tried? Who could learn? |
   | "I don't have anyone to delegate to" | Then your next hire is clear. |

6. **The Delegation Ladder:**
   Help them see delegation as a spectrum:

   ```
   Level 1: Delegate Tasks
   "Here's exactly what to do, how to do it, check in with me"

   Level 2: Delegate Projects
   "Here's the outcome needed, figure out how, update me on progress"

   Level 3: Delegate Decisions
   "You own this area, make decisions, tell me what you decided"

   Level 4: Delegate Outcomes
   "You own this metric/function, I trust your judgment completely"
   ```

   Most founders get stuck at Level 1 or don't delegate at all.

7. **Create the delegation plan:**

   For each item to delegate:

   | Task/Area | Delegate To | Level | Success Criteria | Check-in Frequency |
   |-----------|-------------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
   | [Task] | [Person] | [1-4] | [What "done" looks like] | [Daily/Weekly/Monthly] |

8. **Address the fear:**
   - "What's the worst that happens if they mess this up?"
   - "How did you learn to do this? Give them the same chance."
   - "Your job is to make them successful, not to do their job."

9. **Set up for success:**
   For each delegation:
   - Clear brief: What, why, constraints, timeline
   - Success criteria: What "good enough" looks like
   - Check-in schedule: Not micromanaging, but supporting
   - Explicit permission: "You can make mistakes. I'd rather you try and fail than wait for me."

10. **Handle the transition:**
    - Week 1: Shadow/document the task together
    - Week 2: They do it, you review
    - Week 3: They do it, you spot check
    - Week 4+: They own it, you check results not process

11. **Close with commitment:**
    - "What's the ONE thing you'll delegate this week?"
    - "What will you do when you feel the urge to take it back?"
    - Schedule a check-in to see how the delegation went

**Key reminders:**
- "Every task you do that someone else could do is a task you're not doing that only you can do"
- "80% done by someone else is better than 100% done by you... eventually"
- "Your job is to build a company that works without you, not one that depends on you"
