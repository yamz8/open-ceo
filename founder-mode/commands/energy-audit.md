Audit the founder's time and energy to find misalignments and reclaim capacity.

**Tone:** Practical coach. Data-driven but empathetic about the reality.

**Process:**

1. **Load context (if available):**
   - Check `.claude/founder-mode.local.md` for current time allocation and energy profile
   - If no config, gather this information now

2. **Map current reality:**
   Ask about a typical week:
   - "Walk me through your last week. Where did your hours actually go?"
   - "Which days did you end feeling energized vs. drained?"
   - "What's eating more time than it should?"

3. **Create the energy audit table:**

   | Activity | Hours/Week | Energy Effect | CEO-Leverage |
   |----------|------------|---------------|--------------|
   | [Activity] | [X] | +/0/- | High/Med/Low |

   **Energy Effect:**
   - (+) Energizing - you leave with more than you came with
   - (0) Neutral - necessary but doesn't move the needle either way
   - (-) Draining - leaves you depleted

   **CEO-Leverage:**
   - High = Only you can do this, directly moves company forward
   - Medium = Important but others could contribute
   - Low = Could be delegated, automated, or eliminated

4. **Identify the four quadrants:**

   | | Energizing (+) | Draining (-) |
   |---|---|---|
   | **High Leverage** | PROTECT THIS | Get support or redesign |
   | **Low Leverage** | Delegate (even if you like it) | ELIMINATE OR DELEGATE |

5. **Find the energy vampires:**
   Look for:
   - Recurring meetings with no clear purpose
   - Tasks you do because "it's faster if I just do it"
   - People who drain you vs. energize you
   - Admin work that could be automated or delegated
   - Context-switching patterns

6. **Examine maker vs. manager time:**
   - How many uninterrupted 2+ hour blocks do you have per week?
   - When is your deep work scheduled (or is it not)?
   - Are you protecting your best hours for your best work?

7. **Check sustainability:**
   - Total hours working per week
   - Sleep quality and hours
   - Exercise frequency
   - Time with family/friends
   - When was your last real break?

8. **Create the reallocation plan:**

   **Stop/Eliminate:**
   - [Activity] - [Why it doesn't matter]
   - [Activity] - [Why it doesn't matter]

   **Delegate:**
   - [Activity] → [Who] - [By when]
   - [Activity] → [Who] - [By when]

   **Protect/Increase:**
   - [Activity] - [Specific time blocks to schedule]
   - [Activity] - [Specific time blocks to schedule]

   **Redesign:**
   - [Activity] - [How to make it less draining]

9. **Create calendar boundaries:**
   Suggest specific rules:
   - "No meetings before [time] - that's deep work time"
   - "Meeting-free day: [day of week]"
   - "[Day] afternoons = admin batching"
   - "No work after [time] - non-negotiable"

10. **Close with commitment:**
    - "What's ONE change you'll make this week?"
    - "What will you say when someone tries to violate your boundaries?"
    - Suggest reviewing in 2-4 weeks to see if changes stuck

**Key insights to surface:**
- Most CEOs spend too much time IN the business vs. ON the business
- Your best hours should go to your most important work
- Energy is finite - manage it like you manage money
- Delegation isn't about capability, it's about leverage
