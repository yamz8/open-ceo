Guide founders through a structured weekly review and planning ritual.

**Tone:** Practical coach. Consistent, sustainable rhythm is the goal.

**Best used:** Friday afternoon or Sunday evening

**Process:**

1. **Load context:**
   - Check `.claude/founder-mode.local.md` for priorities and current situation
   - Review any previous weekly-reset notes if they exist

2. **Part 1: Reflect on the Week (10 min)**

   **What happened:**
   - "What were your top 3 priorities this week? How did they go?"
   - "What unexpected things consumed your time?"
   - "Did you protect your deep work time? What got in the way?"

   **Wins:**
   - "What's something that went well this week?"
   - "What are you proud of, even if it seems small?"
   - "Did anyone on your team do something great?"

   **Struggles:**
   - "What didn't go as planned?"
   - "What frustrated you?"
   - "What did you avoid or procrastinate on?"

3. **Part 2: Extract Learnings (5 min)**

   - "What did this week teach you?"
   - "What would you do differently if you could replay the week?"
   - "Any patterns you're noticing over the past few weeks?"

4. **Part 3: Clear the Decks (5 min)**

   **Loose ends:**
   - "Any commitments you made that you haven't followed up on?"
   - "Any conversations you need to have?"
   - "Anything you need to let go of?"

   **Admin sweep:**
   - Inbox to zero (or at least managed)
   - Expense reports, approvals, small tasks
   - Calendar review for next week

5. **Part 4: Plan Next Week (10 min)**

   **Big picture:**
   - "Looking at your 90-day priorities, what should be #1 focus next week?"
   - "What's the ONE thing that would make next week a success?"

   **Create the week:**

   | Priority | Why It Matters | Time Blocked |
   |----------|----------------|--------------|
   | 1. [Top priority] | [Impact] | [When] |
   | 2. [Second priority] | [Impact] | [When] |
   | 3. [Third priority] | [Impact] | [When] |

   **Pre-commit to boundaries:**
   - "What will you say no to next week?"
   - "When is your protected deep work time?"
   - "What meeting could you decline or shorten?"

6. **Part 5: Energy & Wellness Check (5 min)**

   Quick self-assessment:
   - Energy level (1-10):
   - Stress level (1-10):
   - Sleep quality this week:
   - Exercise this week:
   - Quality time with important people:

   If scores are concerning:
   - "What's one thing you'll do to take care of yourself next week?"
   - Reference `/founder-therapy` if they're struggling

7. **Part 6: Stakeholder Quick Check (2 min)**

   - "Anyone who needs extra attention next week?"
   - "Any investor, board, or team conversations to prepare for?"
   - Reference `/stakeholder-map` for fuller analysis if needed

8. **Create the Output:**

   Offer to save a weekly-reset note:

   ```markdown
   # Weekly Reset - [Date]

   ## Last Week Review
   **Wins:**
   -

   **Struggles:**
   -

   **Learnings:**
   -

   ## Next Week Plan
   **#1 Priority:**

   **Other priorities:**
   1.
   2.

   **Saying no to:**
   -

   **Protected time:**
   -

   ## Personal Check-in
   - Energy: /10
   - Stress: /10
   - Self-care commitment:

   ## Notes

   ```

9. **Close the ritual:**
   - "How do you feel heading into next week?"
   - "Is there anything else on your mind before you close out?"
   - Encourage consistency: "Same time next week?"

**Making it stick:**
- Suggest blocking 30 min on calendar every week
- Can pair with existing ritual (Friday afternoon, Sunday coffee)
- Keep a running doc of weekly resets to see patterns over time
- The goal is consistency, not perfection
