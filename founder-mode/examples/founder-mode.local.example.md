## Notes

Currently feeling stretched thin across too many priorities. Need to focus on VP Eng hire as force multiplier. Co-founder relationship is good but we're both overloaded.

Board meeting in 6 weeks - start prep in 4 weeks.

Last real vacation was 8 months ago. Planning a week off after Q2 close.
