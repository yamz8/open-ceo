## Metrics Snapshot

📊 Quick Numbers

## Challenges

**Enterprise sales cycle lengthening**
Seeing cycles extend from 8 to 12 weeks in enterprise. Two factors: (1) tighter budgets requiring more approvals, (2) our POC process is too long.

We're addressing this by:
- Adding ROI calculator to shorten evaluation
- Hiring solutions engineer to accelerate POCs
- Creating "quick start" package for faster time-to-value

## Asks

1. **Intro to Initech** - They're in our sweet spot (Series B fintech, 200 employees). [Board Member], I think you know their CFO?

2. **VP Sales candidates** - Starting search next month. Would love referrals for people who've built enterprise motions at similar stage.

3. **Pricing feedback** - Considering 15% price increase for enterprise tier. Any pattern matching on timing/approach?

---

## Looking Ahead

- Close 3 enterprise deals in pipeline ($180K total ACV)
- Scale self-serve to 50 customers
- Finalize VP Sales job spec and begin search

Thanks for your continued support. Exciting start to the year!

Best,
[CEO Name]
