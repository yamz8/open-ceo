# Example: Milestone Update

A sample investor update announcing a major milestone.

**Subject: Acme Corp Update - We hit $3M ARR! 🎉**

Hi everyone,

Excited to share some big news: **we crossed $3M ARR this week!**

---

## The Milestone

We hit $3M ARR on Tuesday, November 12 - about 2 months ahead of our year-end target.

**By the numbers:**
- $3.0M ARR (up from $2.4M in August)
- 25% growth in 3 months
- 127 paying customers
- $24K average ACV (up from $18K)

---

## How We Got Here

Three things drove this acceleration:

**1. Enterprise motion clicking**
Our new VP Sales (joined in July) rebuilt the enterprise playbook. Results:
- Win rate up from 22% to 35%
- Average deal size up 40%
- Sales cycle down from 14 to 10 weeks

**2. Self-serve compounding**
Self-serve launched in January now at 65 customers and $15K MRR. More importantly, it's generating enterprise leads - 4 of our last 10 enterprise deals started as self-serve trials.

**3. NRR momentum**
Net revenue retention hit 125% this quarter. Our expansion playbook is working - customers are upgrading and adding seats.

---

## What This Means

$3M ARR puts us in strong position for Series B:
- Ahead of most benchmarks for our stage
- Clear path to $5M by mid-next-year
- Unit economics are healthy (3.5x LTV:CAC)

We're not planning to raise immediately - runway is 16 months - but will likely start Series B conversations in Q1.
