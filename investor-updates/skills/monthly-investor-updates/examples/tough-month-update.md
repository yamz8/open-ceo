# Example: Tough Month Update

A sample investor update when challenges outweigh highlights.

**Subject: Acme Corp Monthly Update - March 2024**

Hi everyone,

**TL;DR:**
- Lost our largest customer (Globex) - $150K ARR impact
- ARR down to $1.9M (-8% MoM)
- Taking immediate action on retention and diversification

---

## What Happened

Globex, our largest customer at $150K ACV, churned this month. They were acquired by a competitor who uses a competing solution. We had 30 days notice and explored all options, but the decision was made at acquirer level.

Additionally, two SMB customers churned due to budget cuts ($15K combined).

---

## Honest Assessment

This hurts, and it exposed a concentration risk we should have addressed sooner. At their peak, Globex was 12% of our ARR - too high for a single customer.

What we got right:
- Product wasn't the issue; Globex was a happy customer until acquisition
- Our retention process worked - we escalated appropriately

What we need to improve:
- Customer concentration limits
- Earlier M&A intelligence
- Expansion in existing accounts to diversify

---

## Our Response

**Immediate (this month):**
1. Reached out to all customers >5% of ARR - confirmed health
2. Accelerated 3 pipeline deals - closed 1 already ($40K)
3. Reduced discretionary spend by $15K/month

**Next 60 days:**
4. Launch customer health scoring to catch at-risk accounts earlier
5. Push expansion playbook - target 3 upsells in existing base
6. Set policy: no single customer >8% of ARR going forward

---

## Metrics Update

📊 Quick Numbers
- ARR: $1.9M (-8% MoM)
- MRR: $158K (-$17K)
- Runway: 15 months (down from 17 due to lower revenue)
- Pipeline: $320K (healthy)

---

## Silver Linings

- Pipeline remains strong - $320K in qualified opps
- Self-serve tier growing: 45 customers, $8K MRR
- No product or execution issues - this was an external event
- Team morale solid; everyone rallying

---

## Asks

Given the situation, here's where help would be most valuable:

1. **Customer intros in enterprise segment** - We need to diversify. Any warm intros to companies in [target segment] would be huge.

2. **Pattern matching on concentration risk** - How have your other portfolio companies handled this? Would love to compare notes.

---

## Looking Ahead

- Close 2 pipeline deals ($80K combined)
- Launch health scoring by end of April
- Execute 2 expansion conversations

I'm available for calls this week if anyone wants to discuss in more detail. My calendar is open.

Best,
[CEO Name]
