# Metrics Formatting for Investor Updates

How to present metrics effectively in monthly investor updates.

## Philosophy

Investor updates are NOT board decks. The goal is:
- Quick comprehension (30 seconds)
- Pulse check, not deep analysis
- Highlight changes, not absolute values
- Spark questions for follow-up calls

## What to Include

### Always Include (The Big 3)

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| ARR or MRR | Core business health |
| Growth rate | Trajectory matters more than point-in-time |
| Runway | Existential awareness |

### Include When Notable

| Metric | When to Include |
|--------|-----------------|
| New customers | Strong acquisition month |
| NRR | If >110% (brag-worthy) |
| Churn | If improved significantly |
| Cash balance | If raising or notable change |
| Key product metric | If it's a focus area |

### Leave for Board Deck

- Full P&L breakdown
- Cohort analysis
- CAC/LTV details
- Pipeline breakdown
- Detailed financial projections

## Formatting Options

### Emoji Bullet Format (Recommended)

Clean, scannable, works in all email clients:

```
📊 Quick Numbers
• ARR: $2.4M (+12% MoM)
• Runway: 16 months
• New customers: 8
```

### Simple Table Format

Good for more metrics:

```
| Metric | Current | Change |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ARR | $2.4M | +12% |
| MRR | $200K | +$22K |
| Runway | 16 mo | +2 mo |
```

### Inline Format

For very light updates:

```
Numbers: $2.4M ARR (+12%), 16 months runway, 8 new customers.
```

## Number Formatting

### Rounding Rules

| Value Range | Format | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| <$100K | Full number | $87,500 |
| $100K-$999K | One decimal | $150.5K |
| $1M-$99M | One decimal | $2.4M |
| >$100M | No decimal | $150M |

### Growth Rates

- Always include direction: +12%, -5%
- MoM for monthly updates
- Compare to previous month, not plan
- Use percentage for rates, absolutes for ARR

### Time Periods

Be explicit about the time period:
- MoM = Month over Month
- QoQ = Quarter over Quarter
- YoY = Year over Year

## Directional Indicators

Use visual cues for quick scanning:

```
📈 ARR: $2.4M (+12% MoM)     # Strong growth
📊 ARR: $2.4M (+3% MoM)      # Steady
📉 ARR: $2.2M (-5% MoM)      # Decline (be transparent)
```

Or use arrows:
```
• ARR: $2.4M ↑12%
• Churn: 2.1% ↓ (improved from 2.8%)
• Runway: 16 months →
```

## Context Is Key

Raw numbers without context are meaningless. Add context:

**Good:**
```
ARR: $2.4M (+12% MoM)
Best month ever - driven by 3 enterprise deals closing.
```

**Bad:**
```
ARR: $2.4M
```

## Comparing to Previous Month

For monthly updates, compare to last month:

```
| Metric | This Month | Last Month | Change |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|
| ARR | $2.4M | $2.14M | +12% |
| Customers | 85 | 77 | +8 |
| Runway | 16 mo | 14 mo | +2 mo |
```

## Runway Presentation

Runway deserves special attention:

**Standard format:**
```
Runway: 16 months (through May 2025)
```

**If changed significantly:**
```
Runway: 16 months (+2 months)
Extended through burn reduction and faster collections.
```

**If concerning:**
```
Runway: 8 months
We're actively managing burn and beginning fundraise conversations.
```

## When Metrics Are Bad

Don't hide bad numbers. Present them honestly with context:

```
📊 Metrics Update

ARR: $2.2M (-5% MoM)
Lost 2 customers this month (1 acquisition, 1 budget cut).
Pipeline remains strong - expect rebound next month.

Runway: 14 months
Sufficient for current plan. Monitoring closely.
```

## Sample Metrics Sections

### Strong Month

```
📊 Quick Numbers

• ARR: $2.4M (+12% MoM) - best month ever!
• New customers: 8 (vs. 5 last month)
• NRR: 115% - expansion outpacing churn
• Runway: 16 months
```

### Steady Month

```
📊 Quick Numbers

• ARR: $2.2M (+5% MoM)
• New customers: 4
• Runway: 15 months

Solid month. Pipeline building for strong Q4.
```

### Tough Month

```
📊 Quick Numbers

• ARR: $2.0M (-3% MoM)
  Two enterprise churns hit this month (details below)
• New customers: 3
• Runway: 14 months

See Challenges section for context and response plan.
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Too many metrics** - Stick to 3-5 max
2. **No context** - Always explain significant changes
3. **Precision theater** - $2,387,421 → just say $2.4M
4. **Hiding bad news** - Be transparent, add context
5. **Metrics without trends** - Always show direction
6. **Plan comparisons** - Save for board deck; use MoM for updates
