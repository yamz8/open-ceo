## How to Read This Data

### Revenue Cohorts
- **Flat curves**: No expansion or contraction (neutral)
- **Upward curves**: Net expansion (great - customers spending more)
- **Downward curves**: Net contraction (concerning - investigate)

### Logo Cohorts
- **Flat curves**: Strong retention
- **Steep early drops**: Onboarding/activation problem
- **Gradual declines**: Normal expected churn
- **Cliff at specific month**: Contract term issue

### Ideal Patterns
1. Logo retention > 85% at M12
2. Revenue retention > 100% at M12 (NRR > 100%)
3. ARPU growing over customer lifetime
4. Engagement stable or improving
