# Financial Restructuring Guide

## Understanding Your Financial Position

### The Cash Reality Check

Before restructuring, know exactly where you stand:

**Cash position:**
- Current cash balance
- Expected cash in (receivables, revenue)
- Committed cash out (payroll, rent, contracts)
- True monthly burn rate
- Actual runway (cash ÷ burn)

**Common mistakes:**
- Confusing GAAP revenue with cash
- Ignoring seasonality
- Underestimating burn
- Overestimating revenue timing

### The Burn Rate Reality

**Gross burn:** Total cash going out each month
**Net burn:** Gross burn minus cash coming in

| Burn Type | Calculation | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Net burn | Expenses - Revenue | Normal operations |
| Gross burn | Total expenses | Conservative planning |
| Worst case | Gross burn + contingency | Crisis planning |

**Calculate your real burn:**
1. Look at bank statements (not P&L)
2. Average last 3 months (accounts for variability)
3. Add known upcoming expenses
4. Don't include one-time items

### Runway Calculations

**Basic runway:** Cash balance ÷ Monthly burn

**Conservative runway:** Cash balance ÷ (Burn × 1.2)
- Assumes burn is higher than expected
- Use this for planning

**Crisis runway:** Cash balance ÷ Gross burn
- Assumes no revenue
- Use this to understand worst case

## Cost Reduction Tactics

### Payroll Optimization

Payroll is typically 60-80% of startup costs. Options:

**Salary reductions:**
- Temporary 10-20% cuts across the board
- Larger cuts for executives
- Can offer equity compensation
- Set timeline for restoration

**Reduced hours:**
- Move some roles to part-time
- 4-day work week at 80% pay
- Preserves jobs, reduces cost

**Deferred compensation:**
- Defer bonuses
- Delay raises
- Convert cash to equity

**Benefits adjustments:**
- Reduce employer contribution to health premiums
- Pause 401k match
- Reduce paid time off payout

### Vendor Negotiations

**Approach:**
1. List all recurring expenses
2. Prioritize by size and flexibility
3. Contact each vendor to negotiate

**Negotiation tactics:**
- Ask for temporary discount
- Request payment terms extension
- Propose reduced scope at lower price
- Threaten to cancel (carefully)
- Ask about startup/hardship programs

**Common wins:**
| Vendor Type | Typical Negotiation |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Cloud infrastructure | Commitment discount, credit programs |
| SaaS tools | Annual to monthly, reduced seats |
| Office lease | Sublease, early termination |
| Professional services | Deferred payment, reduced scope |

### Infrastructure Optimization

**Cloud costs:**
- Right-size instances (most are over-provisioned)
- Use spot/preemptible instances
- Implement auto-scaling
- Delete unused resources
- Negotiate enterprise agreement

**Typical savings:** 20-40% of cloud spend

### Marketing Spend

**Cut immediately:**
- Experimental channels with no proven ROI
- Brand advertising
- Events and sponsorships
- Agency retainers

**Reduce carefully:**
- Paid acquisition (may need for revenue)
- Content production
- PR

**Preserve:**
- Customer retention marketing
- Channels with proven ROI
- Essential sales tools

## Cash Flow Management

### Accelerating Cash In

**Receivables:**
- Offer discount for early payment (2-3%)
- Follow up aggressively on overdue
- Tighten credit terms for new customers
- Require deposits or prepayment

**Revenue:**
- Offer annual plans at discount
- Pre-sell future product/services
- Collect on professional services faster

### Slowing Cash Out

**Payables:**
- Extend payment terms with vendors
- Pay on due date, not early
- Prioritize critical vendors

**Careful:** Don't damage important relationships or credit

### Cash Flow Forecasting

Create a 13-week cash flow forecast:

| Week | Starting Cash | Cash In | Cash Out | Ending Cash |
|------|---------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| ... | | | | |
| 13 | | | | |

**Update weekly.** This is your lifeline in a crisis.

## Bridge Financing

### Types of Bridge Financing

**Convertible note:**
- Debt that converts to equity
- Typical terms: 2-year maturity, 5-8% interest
- 15-25% conversion discount
- May have valuation cap

**SAFE:**
- Not debt (no maturity or interest)
- Simpler documentation
- Converts at next priced round
- Typical discount: 15-25%

**Venture debt:**
- From banks or specialty lenders
- Requires warrants typically
- Need to show path to repayment
- Best when you have revenue

### Negotiating Bridge Terms

**What to push for:**
- Lower discount
- Higher or no valuation cap
- No participation rights
- Flexible conversion triggers
- Longer maturity

**What to accept if needed:**
- Reasonable discount (20%)
- Valuation cap at fair value
- Participation in next round
- Board observer rights

**Watch out for:**
- Aggressive caps that dilute heavily
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- Excessive control provisions
- Short maturity with bad terms

### The Bridge Pitch

**To existing investors:**
> "We need [amount] to get to [milestone]. Here's why:
> - Current runway: [X months]
> - What we'll accomplish: [specific goals]
> - Why we'll succeed: [evidence]
> - What we need from you: [specific ask]"

**Key points:**
- Be honest about why you need it
- Show a credible plan to milestone
- Explain how you'll reduce burn
- Ask for what you need, not less

## Emergency Measures

### When Runway is <3 Months

**Immediate actions:**
1. Stop all non-essential spending today
2. Freeze hiring completely
3. Call board members individually
4. Assess bridge options immediately
5. Consider layoffs (see `/layoff-plan`)

**Cash preservation mode:**
- Pay only legal obligations
- Delay everything else
- Focus team on revenue

### Prioritizing Payments

**Must pay (legal and practical):**
1. Payroll (legal obligation, team retention)
2. Payroll taxes (personal liability for founders)
3. Health insurance premiums
4. Rent (or negotiate)
5. Critical vendors for operations

**Can negotiate/delay:**
- Trade payables
- Non-critical software
- Contractors
- Professional services

**Board considerations:**
If you're insolvent (can't pay obligations), directors have duties to creditors, not just shareholders. Get legal advice.

## Working with Your Board

### The Restructuring Conversation

**What to share:**
- Honest assessment of situation
- How you got here
- Options considered
- Your recommended path
- What you need from them

**What to ask for:**
- Financial support (bridge)
- Strategic input
- Network for customers/partners
- Support for difficult decisions

### Getting Board Support

**Do:**
- Inform early (no surprises)
- Bring a plan, not just a problem
- Be honest about prognosis
- Show you're taking it seriously
- Ask for specific help

**Don't:**
- Surprise them with crisis
- Be defensive
- Blame external factors only
- Ask for open-ended support
- Hide the severity

## Financial Controls During Crisis

### Spending Controls

**Implement immediately:**
- All new spending requires founder approval
- Hiring freeze
- Travel freeze (or approval required)
- Reduced expense limits

### Reporting Frequency

**Normal times:** Monthly financial review
**Warning mode:** Bi-weekly
**Crisis mode:** Weekly cash report

### Key Metrics to Watch

**Weekly:**
- Cash balance
- Cash burn
- Runway
- Revenue collected (not booked)

**Monthly:**
- Full P&L
- Customer metrics (churn, expansion)
- Pipeline health
- Headcount

## Recovery Indicators

### Signs the Restructuring is Working

**Financial:**
- Burn decreasing as planned
- Revenue stabilizing or growing
- Cash balance stabilizing
- Bridge successfully raised

**Operational:**
- Team executing on plan
- Customer relationships stable
- Key hires retained
- Product progress continuing

**Strategic:**
- Path to profitability clearer
- Market position defensible
- Next round path visible

### Signs More Action is Needed

**Red flags:**
- Burn not decreasing as expected
- Revenue declining faster than cost
- Key people leaving
- Customer churn accelerating
- Bridge investors hesitant

If you see these, you may need another round of restructuring or more dramatic action.
