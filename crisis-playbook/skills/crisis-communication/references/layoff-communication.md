# Layoff Communication Guide

## The Three Conversations

A layoff requires three distinct communications:

1. **The individual conversation** (affected employees)
2. **The manager briefing** (those delivering news)
3. **The team announcement** (remaining employees)

Each requires different preparation and approach.

## Conversation 1: Telling Affected Employees

### Preparation

**Before the conversation:**
- Know exactly what severance/benefits you're offering
- Have paperwork ready
- Book private space (not their desk, not glass conference room)
- Allocate 15-30 minutes
- Have HR or another leader present if possible
- Know their specific situation (tenure, visa status, etc.)

### The Conversation Structure

**Total time: 15-30 minutes**

1. **Open directly (30 seconds)**
   - Don't make small talk
   - Get to the point
   - "I have difficult news. Your position is being eliminated."

2. **Deliver the news clearly (1-2 minutes)**
   - State the decision
   - Brief context (company situation, not their performance unless relevant)
   - This is the decision, not a negotiation

3. **Explain the package (3-5 minutes)**
   - Severance amount and timing
   - Benefits continuation
   - Equity treatment
   - References
   - Outplacement support

4. **Allow reaction (5-10 minutes)**
   - Silence is okay - let them process
   - Don't over-explain or fill silence
   - Be present and human
   - Don't make promises you can't keep

5. **Explain logistics (2-3 minutes)**
   - When is last day
   - What happens to access/equipment
   - How to collect belongings
   - Who to contact for questions

6. **Close with dignity (1-2 minutes)**
   - Thank them genuinely
   - Offer to be a reference if appropriate
   - Provide contact for questions

### What to Say

**Opening:**
> "Thank you for meeting with me. I have difficult news. We're making reductions to the team, and your position is being eliminated. I want to explain what this means and answer your questions."

**If they ask "Why me?":**
> "We made decisions based on the roles and skills we need going forward. This isn't a reflection of your work or value."

**If they get emotional:**
> "I understand this is hard. Take the time you need."
> [Silence is okay]

**If they get angry:**
> "I understand you're upset. That's a normal reaction. I'm here to answer your questions when you're ready."

**If they negotiate:**
> "I understand you'd like to discuss this. The decision has been made, but I can answer questions about the package."

**Closing:**
> "I know this is a lot to process. [HR/Person] will follow up with paperwork and details. You can reach out to [contact] with questions. Thank you for everything you've contributed here."

### What NOT to Say

- "I know how you feel" (you don't)
- "This is harder for me than you" (it's not)
- "You'll be fine, you're talented" (not the time)
- "We might be able to bring you back later" (don't promise)
- "It's the economy/investors/etc." (take responsibility)
- Anything about other affected employees
- Details about why others were kept

### Difficult Scenarios

**Remote employees:**
- Video call, not phone
- Have their manager or HR present
- Send follow-up email with all details
- Offer phone support for questions

**Visa holders:**
- Know their specific visa timeline
- Have immigration counsel available
- Provide documentation quickly
- Consider extended transition if possible

**Long-tenured employees:**
- Acknowledge their history
- Consider enhanced severance
- Personal call from CEO if appropriate

**High performers caught in reduction:**
- Acknowledge directly that this isn't about performance
- Offer strong references
- Consider if there's truly no way to retain

## Conversation 2: Manager Briefing

### Before Layoff Day

Managers who will deliver news need:

**Information:**
- Who on their team is affected
- Why these specific decisions
- Severance details
- Timeline and logistics
- Talking points for remaining team

**Support:**
- Script and guidance
- Answers to anticipated questions
- HR backup available
- Emotional preparation

**Clear instructions:**
- Exactly when to have conversations
- In what order
- Where to do it
- Who else should be present
- What to do if it goes badly

### Manager Briefing Script

> "Thank you for being here. Tomorrow we're conducting a reduction in force. Your team is affected, and I need your help to do this well.
>
> Here's who is affected on your team: [names]
>
> Here's the timeline for tomorrow: [logistics]
>
> Here's the script and talking points: [provide]
>
> I know this is hard. You may disagree with some decisions. I need you to deliver this news with professionalism and compassion. Can you do that?
>
> After the individual conversations, we'll do an all-hands at [time]. Then I need you to check in with your remaining team members.
>
> Questions?"

### Supporting Managers Through It

- Acknowledge it's hard for them too
- Give them permission to have emotions (after the conversations)
- Provide clear escalation path if conversations go badly
- Plan debrief/support after it's done
- Watch for manager burnout in following weeks

## Conversation 3: Team Announcement

### Timing and Logistics

**Timing:**
- Same day as individual conversations
- After ALL affected employees have been told
- Within 1-2 hours of layoffs
- Not Friday afternoon (makes support harder)

**Format:**
- All-hands (everyone, not just remaining team)
- In person if possible, video if remote
- Allow time for Q&A

### Announcement Structure

**Opening (1-2 minutes):**
- Acknowledge this is hard
- State what happened clearly
- Take responsibility

**Context (3-5 minutes):**
- Why was this necessary?
- What alternatives were considered?
- How were decisions made?

**Affected team (2-3 minutes):**
- Acknowledge those leaving
- Describe support being provided
- Thank them

**Remaining team (3-5 minutes):**
- What this means for them
- What's NOT changing (if anything)
- What support is available

**Path forward (3-5 minutes):**
- What's the plan now?
- How does this position us?
- What are the priorities?

**Q&A (15-30 minutes):**
- Take questions directly
- Be honest when you don't know
- Don't get defensive

### Sample All-Hands Script

> "Thank you for being here. I have difficult news to share, and I want to be direct with you.
>
> Today we reduced our team by [X] people. This was the hardest decision I've made as CEO.
>
> I want to explain why we made this decision. [Context: business situation, runway, what we tried before getting here]. We considered alternatives including [what you considered], but ultimately determined this was necessary to [reason].
>
> I want to acknowledge our colleagues who are leaving. [Names or acknowledgment]. They contributed significantly to this company, and this decision is not a reflection of their work. We're supporting them with [severance details].
>
> For those of you staying: I know you have questions. You're wondering if your job is safe, if there will be more cuts, what this means for your work. Let me address those directly:
>
> - [Is this it, or could there be more?]
> - [What changes for remaining team?]
> - [What support is available?]
>
> Here's what comes next. Our focus is now on [priorities]. With this team, I'm confident we can [goal/milestone].
>
> I know today is hard. It's okay to have feelings about this - grief, anger, fear, relief. All of those are valid. [Support resources available].
>
> Now I want to hear from you. What questions do you have?"

### Common Questions and Answers

**"Am I safe? Will there be more layoffs?"**
> "I can't promise there will never be another change. What I can promise is that we made this cut deep enough that I believe we won't need to do this again. And I'll be transparent with you about where we stand."

**"How were decisions made?"**
> "We looked at the roles and capabilities we need going forward. It wasn't about individual performance in most cases. [If it was performance-related for some, don't say that publicly.]"

**"Why didn't leadership take pay cuts instead?"**
> "[If you did]: We did - [details]. [If you didn't]: That wouldn't have been enough to address the gap, but I understand the question."

**"What about the people who left? Are they okay?"**
> "We're providing [severance details]. I won't speak to individual situations, but we're trying to support them through this transition."

**"How should we handle this with customers/partners?"**
> "[Provide guidance]. If you're unsure what to say, please check with [person]."
