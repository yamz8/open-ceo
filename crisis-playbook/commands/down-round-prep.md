Help founders navigate the emotionally and legally complex process of raising at a lower valuation.

**Tone:** Pragmatic and supportive. Down rounds are hard but not the end.

**Important:** This is guidance, not legal or financial advice. Work with your lawyers and advisors.

**Process:**

1. **Acknowledge the situation:**
   - "Down rounds are tough emotionally and logistically. Let's make sure you navigate this well."
   - "The goal is to get the company funded with a structure that still motivates everyone."

2. **Load context:**
   - Check `.claude/metrics.local.md` for last valuation, current metrics
   - "What was your last round valuation? What are investors valuing you at now?"

## Part 1: Understanding the Situation

3. **Assess the gap:**

   | Last Round | Current Offer | Gap |
   |------------|---------------|-----|
   | $[X]M pre | $[Y]M pre | [Z]% down |

   **Severity scale:**
   - 0-20% down: Flat to modest down, manageable
   - 20-50% down: Significant, needs careful structuring
   - 50%+ down: Severe, major restructuring needed

4. **Understand who's affected:**

   **Stakeholders in a down round:**
   | Who | Impact | Concern |
   |-----|--------|---------|
   | Founders | Dilution, potentially underwater options | Motivation, control |
   | Employees | Options may be underwater, dilution | Retention, morale |
   | Previous investors | Their shares worth less | Protecting ownership, anti-dilution |
   | New investors | Getting better price | Ensuring motivated team |

5. **Key terms to understand:**

   **Anti-dilution provisions:**
   - **Full ratchet:** Previous investors get repriced to new price (severe dilution to founders/employees)
   - **Weighted average:** Previous investors get partial protection (most common)
   - **Broad-based weighted average:** Most founder-friendly version

   "Do your existing investors have anti-dilution rights? What type?"

   **Pay-to-play:**
   - Requires existing investors to invest in the new round to keep their preferences
   - Can help clean up cap table and reset dynamics

## Part 2: Negotiation Strategy

6. **Identify your leverage:**

   Even in a down round, you may have leverage:
   - Alternative paths (bridge from existing investors, acqui-hire, other terms sheets)
   - Key relationships or contracts
   - Technology or IP value
   - Team quality

   "What alternatives do you have? Even weak alternatives create leverage."

7. **Key negotiation points:**

   | Issue | Why It Matters | What to Push For |
   |-------|---------------|------------------|
   | Valuation | Total dilution | Best price you can get, but don't die on this hill |
   | Anti-dilution trigger | How much existing investors get adjusted | Broad-based weighted average, not full ratchet |
   | Option pool refresh | Employee motivation | New pool AFTER down round pricing |
   | Founder vesting | Your ownership | Waive anti-dilution on founder shares if possible |
   | Pay-to-play | Cap table cleanup | Include if helpful, resist if existing investors are allies |
   | Liquidation preferences | Payout in exit | Non-participating preferred, 1x (not 2x+) |
   | Board composition | Control | Maintain balance if possible |

8. **The refresh conversation:**

   Down rounds often need equity refresh to keep team motivated:
   - New option grants to make team whole (or closer)
   - Top-up grants for key people
   - Retention packages for flight risks

   "Your team's options may be underwater. How will you keep them motivated?"

## Part 3: Communication

9. **Communicating with existing investors:**

   **What they need to hear:**
   - Honest assessment of what went wrong
   - Clear plan for how new capital will be used
   - Why this investor/terms are the right choice
   - What you need from them (waivers, support, bridge)

   **Script:**
   > "I want to talk about our fundraise. We're seeing valuations at [X], which is below our last round. Here's why this is happening... Here's our plan going forward... What we need from you is [specific ask]."

10. **Communicating with the team:**

    **Timing:** After the round is closed (don't announce until certain)

    **What they need to hear:**
    - Honest assessment without dooming
    - What this means for their equity
    - What you're doing to make it right (refresh)
    - Confidence in the path forward

    **Script:**
    > "I want to share some news about our funding. We raised [amount] at a valuation lower than our last round. Here's why this happened... Here's what it means for you and your equity... Here's what we're doing to make sure you're still well-positioned... Here's why I'm confident about our future..."

    **Don't:**
    - Pretend it's not a down round
    - Over-apologize or seem defeated
    - Promise things you can't deliver

11. **Communicating with candidates/new hires:**

    **Be honest but framed:**
    - "We raised at a lower valuation than our previous round"
    - "Here's why I think this is actually a good entry point"
    - "Here's the equity package and why I think it's valuable"

    ```

15. **Close with perspective:**
    - "Many successful companies had down rounds. It's a funding event, not a judgment."
    - "The best founders use this as a reset and come back stronger."
    - "Focus on what you can control: execution."

**Remember:**
- A down round is better than no round
- Protect what matters: motivated team, clean cap table, enough runway
- The goal is to get back to a position of strength
- Your reputation for handling hard things well matters
