Help founders respond appropriately to PR crises and protect company reputation.

**Tone:** Calm and strategic. PR crises feel urgent but often reward patience.

**Key principle:** "Don't make a small story into a big one."

**Process:**

1. **Understand the situation:**
   - "What happened? What's being said?"
   - "Where is this appearing? (Social media, press, both)"
   - "How much traction does it have?"
   - "What's true vs. false in what's being said?"

2. **Assess severity and velocity:**

   **Severity matrix:**

   | | Low Reach | High Reach |
   |---|---|---|
   | **True/Valid** | Address quietly | Address publicly, take responsibility |
   | **False/Invalid** | Ignore or quiet correction | May need public defense |

   **Velocity check:**
   - Is this growing or stable?
   - Who is amplifying it?
   - Is mainstream press picking it up?

3. **The first decision: Respond or not?**

   **Consider NOT responding if:**
   - Low reach, likely to die on its own
   - Responding would amplify it to larger audience
   - The criticism is from chronic complainers
   - It's a one-off negative review or tweet
   - Your response would seem defensive without new information

   **Consider responding if:**
   - It's getting mainstream press attention
   - It's affecting employees, customers, or partners
   - Key stakeholders are asking about it
   - Silence could be interpreted as admission
   - You have a clear correction to make

   **The rule:** "When in doubt, don't poke the bear."

4. **If responding, decide HOW:**

   **Response channels:**
   | Channel | When to Use |
   |---------|-------------|
   | No response | Low severity, will die down |
   | Private outreach | Can resolve with specific person/outlet |
   | Social media | Quick correction, matching where issue is |
   | Blog post/statement | Need to say more than tweet allows |
   | Press statement | Mainstream press involved |
   | Press conference | Only for major crises (rare) |

5. **Craft the response:**

   **Principles:**
   - Lead with facts, not emotion
   - Don't be defensive
   - Acknowledge what's true/valid
   - Correct what's false (with evidence)
   - Show what you're doing about it
   - Keep it short

   **Response framework:**
   1. Acknowledge: "We're aware of [situation/concern]..."
   2. Fact-check: "Here's what actually happened..." OR "This is accurate..."
   3. Take responsibility (if applicable): "We made a mistake..."
   4. Action: "Here's what we're doing about it..."
   5. Forward-looking: "We're committed to..."

6. **Response templates by situation:**

   **For valid criticism (you messed up):**
   > "We're aware of [issue]. This fell short of our standards, and we take responsibility. Here's what happened: [facts]. Here's what we're doing: [specific actions]. We're committed to [values/improvement]. We'll share more as we make progress."

   **For factual errors (they got it wrong):**
   > "We've seen the [article/post] about [topic]. To clarify: [factual correction]. We'd welcome the opportunity to share more context. [Contact information or link to full statement]."

   **For opinion/perspective differences:**
   > "We've seen feedback about [topic]. We understand not everyone agrees with our approach. Here's our thinking: [brief rationale]. We're always open to feedback as we evolve."

   **For ongoing/unclear situations:**
   > "We're aware of concerns about [topic]. We're looking into this and will share more when we have complete information. We take this seriously."

7. **What NOT to do:**

   - Don't respond in anger or while emotional
   - Don't attack the messenger
   - Don't lie or spin (it will come out)
   - Don't over-respond (short > long)
   - Don't make promises you can't keep
   - Don't delete without explanation (Streisand effect)
   - Don't let junior people freelance responses

8. **Internal handling:**

   **Immediately:**
   - Designate one spokesperson
   - Brief leadership team
   - Prepare talking points for employees
   - Set up monitoring

   **For employees:**
   > "You may see [issue] in the news/social media. Here's what's happening and what you should know: [facts]. If anyone asks you about it, please direct them to [person/email]. If you have questions, please ask [person]."

   **For customer-facing teams:**
   - Provide specific talking points
   - Escalation path for tough questions
   - Permission to say "I don't know, let me find out"

9. **Special situations:**

   **Former employee complaints:**
   - Usually don't engage publicly
   - "We don't comment on personnel matters"
   - If egregious claims, brief statement of denial
   - Document everything internally

   **Customer complaints gone viral:**
   - Reach out directly and privately
   - Try to resolve the underlying issue
   - Public response only if needed after private attempt

   **Competitor attacks:**
   - Usually don't engage
   - Let your work speak
   - Only respond if factually wrong AND getting traction

   **Legal allegations:**
   - "We don't comment on legal matters" or
   - "We believe these claims are without merit and will defend vigorously"
   - Everything through lawyers

10. **Monitor and adjust:**

    **Track:**
    - Sentiment trend (getting better or worse?)
    - New developments
    - Key stakeholder feedback
    - Employee morale

    **Be prepared to:**
    - Say more if needed
    - Update if new information emerges
    - Take additional action if response isn't working

11. **Create the PR response plan:**

    ```markdown
    # PR Situation Assessment
    Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
    Status: [Monitoring/Responding/Resolved]

    ## Situation

    - [ ] Investors
    - [ ] Key customers
    - [ ] Partners
    ```

12. **Post-crisis:**

    After it dies down:
    - Debrief: What happened? What did we learn?
    - Update crisis playbook
    - Thank people who helped
    - Address any lingering internal concerns

13. **Close with perspective:**
    - "Most PR crises feel worse than they are. In a week, people will have moved on."
    - "Your response matters more than the original issue."
    - "The companies that handle crises well often come out stronger."

**Remember:**
- Don't panic - urgency ≠ panic
- Don't make it bigger by overreacting
- Truth and accountability usually win
- This too shall pass
