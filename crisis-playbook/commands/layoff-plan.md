Help founders plan and execute layoffs professionally, legally, and with dignity.

**Tone:** Direct but compassionate. This is one of the hardest things founders do.

**Important:** This provides frameworks, not legal advice. Always involve employment counsel.

**Process:**

1. **Acknowledge the difficulty:**
   - "Layoffs are one of the hardest things you'll do as a CEO."
   - "Let's make sure we do this right - for the company and for the people affected."

2. **Load context:**
   - Check `.claude/metrics.local.md` for runway, burn, headcount
   - If no data, ask: "How many employees total? How many need to be let go? What's driving this decision?"

3. **Validate the decision:**

   Before planning execution, ensure this is the right call:
   - "What alternatives have you considered?" (hiring freeze, salary cuts, reduced hours)
   - "Does this reduction actually solve the problem?"
   - "How long will this extend runway?"
   - "Is one cut deep enough, or will you need another?"

   **The golden rule:** Cut once, cut deep enough. Multiple rounds destroy morale.

4. **Determine the reduction:**

   | Approach | When to Use |
   |----------|-------------|
   | Performance-based | You have clear underperformers, need is modest |
   | Role elimination | Certain functions no longer needed |
   | Across-the-board % | Need significant reduction, want to seem fair |
   | Strategic reshape | Using crisis to restructure for different future |

   **Key questions:**
   - What capabilities must we retain?
   - What's the minimum viable team?
   - Who are the critical people we cannot lose?

5. **Create the list:**

   **Criteria to consider (document your rationale):**
   - Performance and potential
   - Critical skills and knowledge
   - Role necessity going forward
   - NOT: protected class status, recent leave, etc.

   **Warning signs to flag:**
   - Disproportionate impact on any protected group
   - Targeting anyone who recently complained, took leave, etc.
   - Keeping friends over better performers

   **Always have counsel review the list before proceeding.**

6. **Plan the logistics:**

   **Timeline:**
   | Day | Activity |
   |-----|----------|
   | D-7 to D-3 | Finalize list with counsel, prepare packages, train managers |
   | D-1 | Brief managers who will deliver news |
   | D-Day | Conduct all conversations (same day, short window) |
   | D+1 | All-hands for remaining team |
   | D+1 to D+7 | Support affected employees, manage transition |

   **Severance package considerations:**
   - Weeks of pay (typically 1-4 weeks per year of service)
   - Benefits continuation (COBRA subsidy?)
   - Equity treatment (acceleration? extended exercise?)
   - Outplacement support
   - Reference policy

7. **Prepare the communications:**

   **For affected employees (the conversation):**
   - Keep it short and clear (under 15 minutes)
   - Lead with the decision, then explain
   - Be human but don't over-explain or apologize excessively
   - Have details ready (severance, benefits, timeline)
   - Allow dignity - private space, time to process

   **Script template:**
   > "[Name], I have difficult news. We're reducing our team, and your position is being eliminated. This is not about your performance - it's about the company's situation. Here's what this means for you... [severance details]. I'm sorry this is happening. What questions do you have?"

   **For remaining team (all-hands):**
   - Be honest about why
   - Acknowledge the people leaving
   - Explain what this means going forward
   - Allow time for questions and emotions
   - Commit to transparency

   **For external stakeholders:**
   - Board: Inform before execution
   - Investors: Same day or next day
   - Customers: If they're affected or will notice
   - Press: Only if necessary (often isn't)

8. **Manager preparation:**

   Managers delivering the news need:
   - Clear script and talking points
   - Answers to likely questions
   - HR/counsel support available
   - Emotional preparation (this is hard for them too)
   - Clear logistics (when, where, who's in room)

9. **Day-of execution:**

   **Do:**
   - All conversations in short window (2-3 hours)
   - Private, dignified spaces
   - Have support people available (HR, counsel)
   - Disable access at appropriate time (after conversation)
   - Allow people to collect belongings

   **Don't:**
   - Drag it out over days
   - Let rumors spread before official news
   - Have security escort people out visibly
   - Schedule for Friday afternoon (makes it harder to get support)

10. **After the layoff:**

    **For affected employees:**
    - Clear offboarding process
    - Prompt severance payment
    - LinkedIn recommendations if appropriate
    - Alumni network if you create one

    **For remaining team:**
    - 1:1s with everyone in following week
    - Address survivor's guilt
    - Clarify new structure and responsibilities
    - Acknowledge increased load, be realistic

    **For you:**
    - Process this emotionally (it's hard)
    - Learn from it
    - Document what happened and why

11. **Create the layoff plan document:**
