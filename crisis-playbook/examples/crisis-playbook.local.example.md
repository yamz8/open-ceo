## Current Situation

We're facing a cash crisis. Raised Series A 14 months ago at $25M valuation. Growth has been slower than expected and our runway is now 8 months with no clear path to profitability.

## Actions Taken

- Implemented hiring freeze 2 months ago
- Cut marketing spend by 40%
- Exploring bridge financing with existing investors

## Open Questions

- Do we need to do layoffs?
- Should we pursue a bridge or try to raise a full round?
- Is a pivot worth considering?

## Key Relationships

- Lead investor relationship is good, they're supportive but cautious
- Team morale is declining
- Key customers are stable but asking questions
